Title: addressing privacy requirements in system design: the pris method
Abstract: A major challenge in the field of software engineering is to make users trust the software that they use in their every day activities for professional or recreational reasons. Trusting software depends on various elements, one of which is the protection of user privacy. Protecting privacy is about complying with user’s desires when it comes to handling personal information. Users’ privacy can also be defined as the right to determine when, how and to what extend information about them is communicated to others. Current research stresses the need for addressing privacy issues during the system design rather than during the system implementation phase. To this end, this paper describes PriS, a security requirements engineering method, which incorporates privacy requirements early in the system development process. PriS considers privacy requirements as organisational goals that need to be satisfied and adopts the use of privacy-process patterns as a way to: (1) describe the effect of privacy requirements on business processes; and (2) facilitate the identification of the system architecture that best supports the privacy-related business processes. In this way, PriS provides a holistic approach from ‘high-level’ goals to ‘privacy-compliant’ IT systems. The PriS way-of-working is formally defined thus, enabling the development of automated tools for assisting its application.  }

Title: when security meets software engineering: a case of modelling secure information systems
Abstract: Although security is a crucial issue for information systems, traditionally, it is considered after the definition of the system. This approach often leads to problems, which most of the times translate into security vulnerabilities. From the viewpoint of the traditional security paradigm, it should be possible to eliminate such problems through better integration of security and software engineering. This paper firstly argues for the need to develop a methodology that considers security as an integral part of the whole system development process, and secondly it contributes to the current state of the art by proposing an approach that considers security concerns as an integral part of the entire system development process and by relating this approach with existing work. The different stages of the approach are described with the aid of a real-life case study; a health and social care information system.  }
Paper 3:
Title: preventing piracy, reverse engineering, and tampering
Abstract: As computing becomes pervasive, concerns about data protection have taken on new urgency. What makes securing digital data so difficult is that it is rarely static rather, data is manipulated by software, often in a net-worked environment.Software is increasingly being distributed as mobile code in architecture-independent formats. Using reverse engineering, malicious parties can steal the intellectual property associated with such code with relative ease. Three promising techniques under development--tamper proofing, obfuscation, and watermarking--offer hope for providing more efficient and effective mechanisms for protecting software.  }

Title: engineering privacy
Abstract: In this paper we integrate insights from diverse islands of research on electronic privacy to offer a holistic view of privacy engineering and a systematic structure for the discipline's topics. First we discuss privacy requirements grounded in both historic and contemporary perspectives on privacy. We use a three-layer model of user privacy concerns to relate them to system operations (data transfer, storage and processing) and examine their effects on user behavior. In the second part of the paper we develop guidelines for building privacy-friendly systems. We distinguish two approaches: "privacy-by-policy" and "privacy-by-architecture." The privacy-by-policy approach focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices (FIPs), while the privacy-by-architecture approach minimizes the collection of identifiable personal data and emphasizes anonymization and client-side data storage and processing. We discuss both approaches with a view to their technical overlaps and boundaries as well as to economic feasibility. The paper aims to introduce engineers and computer scientists to the privacy research domain and provide concrete guidance on how to design privacy-friendly systems.  }

Title: addressing privacy requirements in system design: the pris method
Abstract: A major challenge in the field of software engineering is to make users trust the software that they use in their every day activities for professional or recreational reasons. Trusting software depends on various elements, one of which is the protection of user privacy. Protecting privacy is about complying with user’s desires when it comes to handling personal information. Users’ privacy can also be defined as the right to determine when, how and to what extend information about them is communicated to others. Current research stresses the need for addressing privacy issues during the system design rather than during the system implementation phase. To this end, this paper describes PriS, a security requirements engineering method, which incorporates privacy requirements early in the system development process. PriS considers privacy requirements as organisational goals that need to be satisfied and adopts the use of privacy-process patterns as a way to: (1) describe the effect of privacy requirements on business processes; and (2) facilitate the identification of the system architecture that best supports the privacy-related business processes. In this way, PriS provides a holistic approach from ‘high-level’ goals to ‘privacy-compliant’ IT systems. The PriS way-of-working is formally defined thus, enabling the development of automated tools for assisting its application.  }

Title: when security meets software engineering: a case of modelling secure information systems
Abstract: Although security is a crucial issue for information systems, traditionally, it is considered after the definition of the system. This approach often leads to problems, which most of the times translate into security vulnerabilities. From the viewpoint of the traditional security paradigm, it should be possible to eliminate such problems through better integration of security and software engineering. This paper firstly argues for the need to develop a methodology that considers security as an integral part of the whole system development process, and secondly it contributes to the current state of the art by proposing an approach that considers security concerns as an integral part of the entire system development process and by relating this approach with existing work. The different stages of the approach are described with the aid of a real-life case study; a health and social care information system.  }

Title: preventing piracy, reverse engineering, and tampering
Abstract: As computing becomes pervasive, concerns about data protection have taken on new urgency. What makes securing digital data so difficult is that it is rarely static rather, data is manipulated by software, often in a net-worked environment.Software is increasingly being distributed as mobile code in architecture-independent formats. Using reverse engineering, malicious parties can steal the intellectual property associated with such code with relative ease. Three promising techniques under development--tamper proofing, obfuscation, and watermarking--offer hope for providing more efficient and effective mechanisms for protecting software.  }

Title: engineering privacy
Abstract: In this paper we integrate insights from diverse islands of research on electronic privacy to offer a holistic view of privacy engineering and a systematic structure for the discipline's topics. First we discuss privacy requirements grounded in both historic and contemporary perspectives on privacy. We use a three-layer model of user privacy concerns to relate them to system operations (data transfer, storage and processing) and examine their effects on user behavior. In the second part of the paper we develop guidelines for building privacy-friendly systems. We distinguish two approaches: "privacy-by-policy" and "privacy-by-architecture." The privacy-by-policy approach focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices (FIPs), while the privacy-by-architecture approach minimizes the collection of identifiable personal data and emphasizes anonymization and client-side data storage and processing. We discuss both approaches with a view to their technical overlaps and boundaries as well as to economic feasibility. The paper aims to introduce engineers and computer scientists to the privacy research domain and provide concrete guidance on how to design privacy-friendly systems.  }

Epoch:5 | IDEA | Scientist133:Thought: Integrating privacy engineering with software security to create a holistic approach for designing secure and private cloud computing services.

In this thought process, I'm motivated by the increasing importance of both software security and user privacy in the era of cloud computing. I've come across several papers (Paper 5, Paper 6, and Paper 7) that discuss these topics separately or in conjunction with other aspects of software engineering. However, there seems to be a gap in integrating these two critical areas into a unified approach for designing secure and private cloud services.

High-level plan:
1. **Survey Current Practices**: Investigate how current cloud service providers address security and privacy concerns.
2. **Literature Review**: Conduct an extensive review of existing literature on software engineering, security, and privacy to identify gaps and opportunities for integration.
3. **Develop a Unified Framework**: Create a framework that integrates principles from secure software engineering with the design principles for privacy-friendly systems.
4. **Validate the Framework**: Use case studies or simulations to validate the effectiveness of this integrated approach in improving both security and privacy.

Ideal outcomes:
- A comprehensive understanding of how to integrate security and privacy into cloud service design.
- A validated framework that can guide developers towards creating secure and private cloud services.
- Improved user trust and legal compliance through better integration of security and privacy considerations.

Justification for novelty:
This idea combines the insights from diverse research areas (software engineering, security, and privacy) to offer a holistic view. It aims to address both security and privacy simultaneously, which is different from existing approaches that often focus on one aspect at a time.

New Idea: 
```json

Title: addressing privacy requirements in system design: the pris method
Abstract: A major challenge in the field of software engineering is to make users trust the software that they use in their every day activities for professional or recreational reasons. Trusting software depends on various elements, one of which is the protection of user privacy. Protecting privacy is about complying with user’s desires when it comes to handling personal information. Users’ privacy can also be defined as the right to determine when, how and to what extend information about them is communicated to others. Current research stresses the need for addressing privacy issues during the system design rather than during the system implementation phase. To this end, this paper describes PriS, a security requirements engineering method, which incorporates privacy requirements early in the system development process. PriS considers privacy requirements as organisational goals that need to be satisfied and adopts the use of privacy-process patterns as a way to: (1) describe the effect of privacy requirements on business processes; and (2) facilitate the identification of the system architecture that best supports the privacy-related business processes. In this way, PriS provides a holistic approach from ‘high-level’ goals to ‘privacy-compliant’ IT systems. The PriS way-of-working is formally defined thus, enabling the development of automated tools for assisting its application.  }

Title: when security meets software engineering: a case of modelling secure information systems
Abstract: Although security is a crucial issue for information systems, traditionally, it is considered after the definition of the system. This approach often leads to problems, which most of the times translate into security vulnerabilities. From the viewpoint of the traditional security paradigm, it should be possible to eliminate such problems through better integration of security and software engineering. This paper firstly argues for the need to develop a methodology that considers security as an integral part of the whole system development process, and secondly it contributes to the current state of the art by proposing an approach that considers security concerns as an integral part of the entire system development process and by relating this approach with existing work. The different stages of the approach are described with the aid of a real-life case study; a health and social care information system.  }

Title: engineering privacy
Abstract: In this paper we integrate insights from diverse islands of research on electronic privacy to offer a holistic view of privacy engineering and a systematic structure for the discipline's topics. First we discuss privacy requirements grounded in both historic and contemporary perspectives on privacy. We use a three-layer model of user privacy concerns to relate them to system operations (data transfer, storage and processing) and examine their effects on user behavior. In the second part of the paper we develop guidelines for building privacy-friendly systems. We distinguish two approaches: "privacy-by-policy" and "privacy-by-architecture." The privacy-by-policy approach focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices (FIPs), while the privacy-by-architecture approach minimizes the collection of identifiable personal data and emphasizes anonymization and client-side data storage and processing. We discuss both approaches with a view to their technical overlaps and boundaries as well as to economic feasibility. The paper aims to introduce engineers and computer scientists to the privacy research domain and provide concrete guidance on how to design privacy-friendly systems.  }

Epoch:5 | IDEA | Scientist151:Thought: Integrating privacy engineering with software security to create a holistic approach for designing secure and private cloud computing services.

In this thought process, I'm motivated by the increasing importance of both software security and user privacy in the era of cloud computing. I've come across several papers (Paper 5, Paper 6, and Paper 7) that discuss these topics separately or in conjunction with other aspects of software engineering. However, there seems to be a gap in integrating these two critical areas into a unified approach for designing secure and private cloud services.

High-level plan:
1. **Survey Current Practices**: Investigate how current cloud service providers address security and privacy concerns.
2. **Literature Review**: Conduct an extensive review of existing literature on software engineering, security, and privacy to identify gaps and opportunities for integration.
3. **Develop a Unified Framework**: Create a framework that integrates principles from secure software engineering with the design principles for privacy-friendly systems.
4. **Validate the Framework**: Use case studies or simulations to validate the effectiveness of this integrated approach in improving both security and privacy.

Ideal outcomes:
- A comprehensive understanding of how to integrate security and privacy into cloud service design.
- A validated framework that can guide developers towards creating secure and private cloud services.
- Improved user trust and legal compliance through better integration of security and privacy considerations.

Justification for novelty:
This idea combines the insights from diverse research areas (software engineering, security, and privacy) to offer a holistic view. It aims to address both security and privacy simultaneously, which is different from existing approaches that often focus on one aspect at a time.

Title: integrating security and systems engineering: towards the modelling of secure information systems
Abstract: Security is a crucial issue for information systems. Traditionally, security is considered after the definition of the system. However, this approach often leads to problems, which translate into security vulnerabilities. From the viewpoint of the traditional security paradigm, it should be possible to eliminate such problems through better integration of security and systems engineering. This paper argues for the need to develop a methodology that considers security as an integral part of the whole system development process. The paper contributes to the current state of the art by proposing an approach that considers security concerns as an integral part of the entire system development process and by relating this approach with existing work. The different stages of the approach are described with the aid of a case study; a health and social care information system.  }

Epoch:5 | IDEA | Scientist72:Thought: Integrating privacy engineering with software security to create a holistic approach for designing secure and private cloud computing services.

In this thought process, I'm motivated by the increasing importance of both software security and user privacy in the era of cloud computing. I've come across several papers (Paper 5, Paper 6, and Paper 7) that discuss these topics separately or in conjunction with other aspects of software engineering. However, there seems to be a gap in integrating these two critical areas into a unified approach for designing secure and private cloud services.

High-level plan:
1. **Survey Current Practices**: Investigate how current cloud service providers address security and privacy concerns.
2. **Literature Review**: Conduct an extensive review of existing literature on software engineering, security, and privacy to identify gaps and opportunities for integration.
3. **Develop a Unified Framework**: Create a framework that integrates principles from secure software engineering with the design principles for privacy-friendly systems.
4. **Validate the Framework**: Use case studies or simulations to validate the effectiveness of this integrated approach in improving both security and privacy.

Ideal outcomes:
- A comprehensive understanding of how to integrate security and privacy into cloud service design.
- A validated framework that can guide developers towards creating secure and private cloud services.
- Improved user trust and legal compliance through better integration of security and privacy considerations.

Justification for novelty:
This idea combines the insights from diverse research areas (software engineering, security, and privacy) to offer a holistic view. It aims to address both security and privacy simultaneously, which is different from existing approaches that often focus on one aspect at a time.

Title: addressing privacy requirements in system design: the pris method
Abstract: A major challenge in the field of software engineering is to make users trust the software that they use in their every day activities for professional or recreational reasons. Trusting software depends on various elements, one of which is the protection of user privacy. Protecting privacy is about complying with user’s desires when it comes to handling personal information. Users’ privacy can also be defined as the right to determine when, how and to what extend information about them is communicated to others. Current research stresses the need for addressing privacy issues during the system design rather than during the system implementation phase. To this end, this paper describes PriS, a security requirements engineering method, which incorporates privacy requirements early in the system development process. PriS considers privacy requirements as organisational goals that need to be satisfied and adopts the use of privacy-process patterns as a way to: (1) describe the effect of privacy requirements on business processes; and (2) facilitate the identification of the system architecture that best supports the privacy-related business processes. In this way, PriS provides a holistic approach from ‘high-level’ goals to ‘privacy-compliant’ IT systems. The PriS way-of-working is formally defined thus, enabling the development of automated tools for assisting its application.  }

Title: when security meets software engineering: a case of modelling secure information systems
Abstract: Although security is a crucial issue for information systems, traditionally, it is considered after the definition of the system. This approach often leads to problems, which most of the times translate into security vulnerabilities. From the viewpoint of the traditional security paradigm, it should be possible to eliminate such problems through better integration of security and software engineering. This paper firstly argues for the need to develop a methodology that considers security as an integral part of the whole system development process, and secondly it contributes to the current state of the art by proposing an approach that considers security concerns as an integral part of the entire system development process and by relating this approach with existing work. The different stages of the approach are described with the aid of a real-life case study; a health and social care information system.  }

Title: preventing piracy, reverse engineering, and tampering
Abstract: As computing becomes pervasive, concerns about data protection have taken on new urgency. What makes securing digital data so difficult is that it is rarely static rather, data is manipulated by software, often in a net-worked environment.Software is increasingly being distributed as mobile code in architecture-independent formats. Using reverse engineering, malicious parties can steal the intellectual property associated with such code with relative ease. Three promising techniques under development--tamper proofing, obfuscation, and watermarking--offer hope for providing more efficient and effective mechanisms for protecting software.  }

Title: software engineering
Abstract: Intended for a sophomore/junior level course in software engineering. The ninth edition of Software Engineering presents a broad perspective of software engineering, focusing on the processes and techniques fundamental to the creation of reliable, software systems. Increased coverage of agile methods and software reuse, along with coverage of 'traditional' plan-driven software engineering, gives readers the most up-to-date view of the field currently available. Practical case studies, a full set of easy-to-access supplements, and extensive web resources make teaching the course easier than ever. The book is now structured into four parts: 1: Introduction to Software Engineering 2: Dependability and Security 3: Advanced Software Engineering 4: Software Engineering Management  }

Title: engineering privacy
Abstract: In this paper we integrate insights from diverse islands of research on electronic privacy to offer a holistic view of privacy engineering and a systematic structure for the discipline's topics. First we discuss privacy requirements grounded in both historic and contemporary perspectives on privacy. We use a three-layer model of user privacy concerns to relate them to system operations (data transfer, storage and processing) and examine their effects on user behavior. In the second part of the paper we develop guidelines for building privacy-friendly systems. We distinguish two approaches: "privacy-by-policy" and "privacy-by-architecture." The privacy-by-policy approach focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices (FIPs), while the privacy-by-architecture approach minimizes the collection of identifiable personal data and emphasizes anonymization and client-side data storage and processing. We discuss both approaches with a view to their technical overlaps and boundaries as well as to economic feasibility. The paper aims to introduce engineers and computer scientists to the privacy research domain and provide concrete guidance on how to design privacy-friendly systems.  }
