Epoch:1 | TOPIC | Scientist0:It's great to be part of this team, Scientist0 here! I've taken a look at our current team members, and I'm excited to dive into some potential research topics that align with our strengths and goals.

Firstly, I'd like to point out that we have a strong foundation in data-related areas, such as data mining, access control, and data security. This got me thinking about the intersection of these topics with emerging technologies like blockchain or edge computing. Perhaps we could explore how these technologies can enhance data protection and security?

Another area that caught my attention is the concept of "data owner." With the growing importance of data ownership and governance, I think it would be fascinating to investigate how this concept can be applied in various domains, such as healthcare or finance.

I also noticed that Scientist48 has worked on topics like Semantic Web and multi-agent systems. This got me thinking about potential applications of these technologies in areas like smart cities or environmental monitoring. Maybe we could explore how these technologies can be used to create more efficient and sustainable systems?

Lastly, I'd love to discuss the idea of integrating data cube and attack graph concepts with machine learning algorithms. By leveraging these techniques, we might be able to develop more robust and adaptive security systems that can better protect against complex cyber threats.

What are your thoughts on these potential research topics? Do any of them resonate with you, or do you have other ideas that you'd like to share?

1. Exploring how blockchain and edge computing can enhance data protection and security.
2. Investigating the concept of "data owner" in various domains, such as healthcare or finance.
3. Applying technologies like Semantic Web and multi-agent systems to areas like smart cities or environmental monitoring.

Epoch:1 | TOPIC | Scientist0:I'm glad we're having this discussion! As Scientist0, I'd like to build upon the potential research topics proposed earlier. Specifically, I think it would be fascinating to explore the intersection of data cube and attack graph concepts with machine learning algorithms.

In our previous work on data cubes, we've seen how they can provide a structured representation of complex data sets, making it easier to analyze and visualize them. Similarly, attack graphs have been instrumental in modeling potential security threats and vulnerabilities in systems. By combining these two concepts with machine learning algorithms, I believe we could develop more robust and adaptive security systems that can detect anomalies and predict potential attacks.

One possible direction for this research would be to investigate how data cube-based representations of complex data sets can be used to inform attack graph models. For instance, by analyzing the relationships between different data cubes, we might be able to identify patterns or correlations that could indicate potential vulnerabilities in a system.

Another angle to explore is how machine learning algorithms can be applied to predict and prevent attacks based on the insights gained from data cube and attack graph analysis. This could involve developing predictive models that take into account various factors, such as network traffic patterns, user behavior, and system configurations.

What are your thoughts on this potential research direction? Do you have any ideas for how we can integrate data cube and attack graph concepts with machine learning algorithms?

Also, I'd like to suggest another potential research topic: exploring the concept of "data redundancy" in various domains. As someone who has worked on access control and data protection, I believe that understanding how data redundancy can impact security is crucial. Perhaps we could investigate ways to detect and mitigate data redundancy-related vulnerabilities in systems?

Let's discuss!

Epoch:1 | TOPIC | Scientist0:I'm excited to dive into this discussion with Scientist7! It's great to see that we share common interests in data protection and security.

Building upon our previous conversation, I'd like to add some insights of my own. As someone who has researched on topics like data cube, attack graph, and data mining, I think it would be fascinating to explore the intersection of these concepts with machine learning algorithms for more robust security systems.

Scientist7 mentioned exploring how blockchain and edge computing can enhance data protection and security. I agree that this is a promising area of research, but I'd like to take it a step further. What if we combined the benefits of blockchain (e.g., immutability, transparency) with the insights gained from analyzing data cubes? We could potentially develop more secure and efficient ways to store and process sensitive information.

Regarding the concept of "data owner," I think it's essential to investigate how this idea can be applied in various domains, such as healthcare or finance. However, I'd also like to propose a related research topic: exploring the impact of data redundancy on security. In today's digital age, we often collect and store vast amounts of data, which can lead to vulnerabilities if not properly managed. By studying data redundancy and its effects on security, we might uncover new ways to detect and mitigate potential threats.

Scientist7 also mentioned applying technologies like Semantic Web and multi-agent systems to areas like smart cities or environmental monitoring. I think this is a great idea, but what if we combined these concepts with our existing knowledge of data cube and attack graph analysis? We could potentially develop more sophisticated systems for monitoring and responding to security threats in complex environments.

Lastly, I'd like to revisit the idea of integrating data cube and attack graph concepts with machine learning algorithms. As Scientist0 mentioned earlier, using data cube-based representations to inform attack graph models or developing predictive models using machine learning algorithms are both promising approaches. However, I think we could take it a step further by exploring how these techniques can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as detecting and preventing attacks on critical infrastructure.

What are your thoughts, Scientist7? Do any of these ideas resonate with you, or do you have alternative research topics that you'd like to propose?

Title: an attack graph-based probabilistic security metric
Abstract: To protect critical resources in today's networked environments, it is desirable to quantify the likelihood of potential multi-step attacks that combine multiple vulnerabilities. This now becomes feasible due to a model of causal relationships between vulnerabilities, namely, attack graph. This paper proposes an attack graph-based probabilistic metric for network security and studies its efficient computation. We first define the basic metric and provide an intuitive and meaningful interpretation to the metric. We then study the definition in more complex attack graphs with cycles and extend the definition accordingly. We show that computing the metric directly from its definition is not efficient in many cases and propose heuristics to improve the efficiency of such computation.  }
Paper 2:
Title: ranking attack graphs
Abstract: A majority of attacks on computer systems result from a combination of vulnerabilities exploited by an intruder to break into the system. An Attack Graph is a general formalism used to model security vulnerabilities of a system and all possible sequences of exploits which an intruder can use to achieve a specific goal. Attack Graphs can be constructed automatically using off-the-shelf model-checking tools. However, for real systems, the size and complexity of Attack Graphs greatly exceeds human ability to visualize, understand and analyze. Therefore, it is useful to identify relevant portions of an Attack Graph. To achieve this, we propose a ranking scheme for the states of an Attack Graph. Rank of a state shows its importance based on factors like the probability of an intruder reaching that state. Given a Ranked Attack Graph, the system administrator can concentrate on relevant subgraphs to figure out how to start deploying security measures. We also define a metric of security of the system based on ranks which the system administrator can use to compare Attack Graphs and determine the effectiveness of various defense measures. We present two algorithms to rank states of an Attack Graph based on the probability of an attacker reaching those states. The first algorithm is similar to the PageRank algorithm used by Google to measure importance of web pages on the World Wide Web. It is flexible enough to model a variety of situations, efficiently computable for large sized graphs and offers the possibility of approximations using graph partitioning. The second algorithm ranks individual states based on the reachability probability of an attacker in a random simulation. Finally, we give examples of an application of ranking techniques to multi-stage cyber attacks.  }

Title: two formal analys s of attack graphs
Abstract: An attack graph is a succinct representation of all paths through a system that end in a state where an intruder has successfully achieved his goal. Today Red Teams determine the vulnerability of networked systems by drawing gigantic attack graphs by hand. Constructing attack graphs by hand is tedious, error-prone, and impractical for large systems. By viewing an attack as a violation of a safety property, we can use off-the-shelf model checking technology to produce attack graphs automatically: a successful path from the intruder's viewpoint is a counterexample produced by the model checker. In this paper we present an algorithm for generating attack graphs using model checking as a sub-routine.Security analysts use attack graphs for detection, defense and forensics. In this paper we present a minimization analysis technique that allows analysts to decide which minimal set of security measures would guarantee the safety of the system. We provide a formal characterization of this problem: we prove that it is polynomially equivalent to the minimum hitting set problem and we present a greedy algorithm with provable bounds. We also present a reliability analysis technique that allows analysts to perform a simple cost-benefit trade-off depending on the likelihoods of attacks. By interpreting attack graphs as Markov Decision Processes we can use the value iteration algorithm to compute the probabilities of intruder success for each attack the graph.  }

Title: toward measuring network security using attack graphs
Abstract: In measuring the overall security of a network, a crucial issue is to correctly compose the measure of individual components. Incorrect compositions may lead to misleading results. For example, a network with less vulnerabilities or a more diversified configuration is not necessarily more secure. To obtain correct compositions of individual measures, we need to first understand the interplay between network components. For example, how vulnerabilities can be combined by attackers in advancing an intrusion. Such an understanding becomes possible with recent advances in modeling network security using attack graphs. Based on our experiences with attack graph analysis, we propose an integrated framework for measuring various aspects of network security. We first outline our principles andmethodologies. We then describe concrete examples to buildintuitions. Finally, we present our formal framework. It is our belief that metrics developed based on the proposed framework will lead to novel quantitative approaches to vulnerability analysis, network hardening, and attack response.  }
Paper 5:
Title: measuring the overall security of network configurations using attack graphs
Abstract: Today's computer systems face sophisticated intrusions during which multiple vulnerabilities can be combined for reaching an attack goal. The overall security of a network system cannot simply be determined based on the number of vulnerabilities. To quantitatively assess the security of networked systems, one must first understand which and how vulnerabilities can be combined for an attack. Such an understanding becomes possible with recent advances in modeling the composition of vulnerabilities as attack graphs. Based on our experiences with attack graph analysis, we explore different concepts and issues on a metric to quantify potential attacks. To accomplish this, we present an attack resistance metric for assessing and comparing the security of different network configurations. This paper describes the metric at an abstract level as two composition operators with features for expressing additional constraints. We consider two concrete cases. The first case assumes the domain of attack resistance to be real number and the second case represents resistances as a set of initial security conditions. We show that the proposed metric satisfies desired properties and that it adheres to common sense. At the same time, it generalizes a previously proposed metric that is also based on attack graphs. It is our belief that the proposed metric will lead to novel quantitative approaches to vulnerability analysis, network hardening, and attack responses.  }

Title: owa trees and their role in security modeling using attack trees
Abstract: We introduce the idea of an OWA node as an extension of the ''and/or'' node and use them to generalize ''and/or'' trees to OWA trees. We provide a semantics for an OWA node. Specifically while an ''or'' node requires only one of the children to be satisfied and an ''and'' node requires ''all'' the children be satisfied the OWA node allows us to model situations in which there is some probabilistic uncertainty in the number of children that need be satisfied. We then use these OWA nodes in the security related problem of constructing attack trees. Techniques for the evaluation of an OWA attack tree for the overall probability of success and cost of an attack are provided. A method is provided for describing different types of attackers.  }
Paper 7:
Title: foundations of attack trees
Abstract: Attack trees have found their way to practice because they have proved to be an intuitive aid in threat analysis. Despite, or perhaps thanks to, their apparent simplicity, they have not yet been provided with an unambiguous semantics. We argue that such a formal interpretation is indispensable to precisely understand how attack trees can be manipulated during construction and analysis. We provide a denotational semantics, based on a mapping to attack suites, which abstracts from the internal structure of an attack tree, we study transformations between attack trees, and we study the attribution and projection of an attack tree.  }

Title: optimal boolean matrix decomposition: application to role engineering
Abstract: A decomposition of a binary matrix into two matrices gives a set of basis vectors and their appropriate combination to form the original matrix. Such decomposition solutions are useful in a number of application domains including text mining, role engineering as well as knowledge discovery. While a binary matrix can be decomposed in several ways, however, certain decompositions better characterize the semantics associated with the original matrix in a succinct but comprehensive way. Indeed, one can find different decompositions optimizing different criteria matching various semantics. In this paper, we first present a number of variants to the optimal Boolean matrix decomposition problem that have pragmatic implications. We then present a unified framework for modeling the optimal binary matrix decomposition and its variants using binary integer programming. Such modeling allows us to directly adopt the huge body of heuristic solutions and tools developed for binary integer programming. Although the proposed solutions are applicable to any domain of interest, for providing more meaningful discussions and results, in this paper, we present the binary matrix decomposition problem in a role engineering context, whose goal is to discover an optimal and correct set of roles from existing permissions, referred to as the role mining problem (RMP). This problem has gained significant interest in recent years as role based access control has become a popular means of enforcing security in databases. We consider several variants of the above basic RMP, including the min-noise RMP, delta-approximate RMP and edge-RMP. Solutions to each of them aid security administrators in specific scenarios. We then model these variants as Boolean matrix decomposition and present efficient heuristics to solve them.  }

Epoch:2 | IDEA | Scientist0:Thought: Developing a novel quantitative approach to vulnerability analysis and network hardening using attack graphs.

My intuitions and motivations for this idea stem from the increasing complexity of modern networks and the growing importance of proactive security measures. Attack graphs have proven to be a valuable tool in visualizing potential attack paths, but existing metrics often rely on simplistic assumptions or lack a clear mathematical foundation. I aim to develop a more robust and generalizable metric that can accurately quantify the vulnerability of a network and provide actionable insights for hardening.

High-level plan:
1. **Literature Review**: Study existing metrics used in attack graph analysis, including their strengths and weaknesses.
2. **Mathematical Foundation**: Develop a mathematical framework that incorporates various factors influencing network vulnerability, such as node centrality, edge weights, and conditional probabilities.
3. **Metric Development**: Design a novel metric that combines these factors to provide a comprehensive measure of network vulnerability.
4. **Experimental Evaluation**: Implement the new metric using real-world attack graphs and compare its performance with existing metrics.
5. **Validation and Refinement**: Validate the results through expert feedback and refine the metric as needed.

Necessary design choices:
* Selecting an appropriate mathematical framework (e.g., graph theory, probability theory)
* Balancing the importance of different factors influencing network vulnerability
* Choosing a suitable evaluation methodology for the new metric

Ideal outcomes:
* A well-validated and generalizable metric that accurately quantifies network vulnerability
* Actionable insights for network hardening and vulnerability reduction
* Improved proactive security measures through more informed decision-making

Justification: The proposed approach differs from existing metrics in its emphasis on a mathematical foundation, comprehensive factor incorporation, and experimental evaluation. This novel approach has the potential to provide a more accurate and generalizable measure of network vulnerability.

Title: toward measuring network security using attack graphs
Abstract: In measuring the overall security of a network, a crucial issue is to correctly compose the measure of individual components. Incorrect compositions may lead to misleading results. For example, a network with less vulnerabilities or a more diversified configuration is not necessarily more secure. To obtain correct compositions of individual measures, we need to first understand the interplay between network components. For example, how vulnerabilities can be combined by attackers in advancing an intrusion. Such an understanding becomes possible with recent advances in modeling network security using attack graphs. Based on our experiences with attack graph analysis, we propose an integrated framework for measuring various aspects of network security. We first outline our principles andmethodologies. We then describe concrete examples to buildintuitions. Finally, we present our formal framework. It is our belief that metrics developed based on the proposed framework will lead to novel quantitative approaches to vulnerability analysis, network hardening, and attack response.  }

Title: measuring the overall security of network configurations using attack graphs
Abstract: Today's computer systems face sophisticated intrusions during which multiple vulnerabilities can be combined for reaching an attack goal. The overall security of a network system cannot simply be determined based on the number of vulnerabilities. To quantitatively assess the security of networked systems, one must first understand which and how vulnerabilities can be combined for an attack. Such an understanding becomes possible with recent advances in modeling the composition of vulnerabilities as attack graphs. Based on our experiences with attack graph analysis, we explore different concepts and issues on a metric to quantify potential attacks. To accomplish this, we present an attack resistance metric for assessing and comparing the security of different network configurations. This paper describes the metric at an abstract level as two composition operators with features for expressing additional constraints. We consider two concrete cases. The first case assumes the domain of attack resistance to be real number and the second case represents resistances as a set of initial security conditions. We show that the proposed metric satisfies desired properties and that it adheres to common sense. At the same time, it generalizes a previously proposed metric that is also based on attack graphs. It is our belief that the proposed metric will lead to novel quantitative approaches to vulnerability analysis, network hardening, and attack responses.  }

Title: an attack graph-based probabilistic security metric
Abstract: To protect critical resources in today's networked environments, it is desirable to quantify the likelihood of potential multi-step attacks that combine multiple vulnerabilities. This now becomes feasible due to a model of causal relationships between vulnerabilities, namely, attack graph. This paper proposes an attack graph-based probabilistic metric for network security and studies its efficient computation. We first define the basic metric and provide an intuitive and meaningful interpretation to the metric. We then study the definition in more complex attack graphs with cycles and extend the definition accordingly. We show that computing the metric directly from its definition is not efficient in many cases and propose heuristics to improve the efficiency of such computation.  }

Title: practical attack graph generation for network defense
Abstract: Attack graphs are a valuable tool to network defenders, illustrating paths an attacker can use to gain access to a targeted network. Defenders can then focus their efforts on patching the vulnerabilities and configuration errors that allow the attackers the greatest amount of access. We have created a new type of attack graph, the multiple-prerequisite graph, that scales nearly linearly as the size of a typical network increases. We have built a prototype system using this graph type. The prototype uses readily available source data to automatically compute network reachability, classify vulnerabilities, build the graph, and recommend actions to improve network security. We have tested the prototype on an operational network with over 250 hosts, where it helped to discover a previously unknown configuration error. It has processed complex simulated networks with over 50,000 hosts in under four minutes.  }

Title: a weakest-adversary security metric for network configuration security analysis
Abstract: A security metric measures or assesses the extent to which a system meets its security objectives. Since meaningful quantitative security metrics are largely unavailable, the security community primarily uses qualitative metrics for security. In this paper, we present a novel quantitative metric for the security of computer networks that is based on an analysis of attack graphs. The metric measures the security strength of a network in terms of the strength of the weakest adversary who can successfully penetrate the network. We present an algorithm that computes the minimal sets of required initial attributes for the weakest adversary to possess in order to successfully compromise a network; given a specific network configuration, set of known exploits, a specific goal state, and an attacker class (represented by a set of all initial attacker attributes). We also demonstrate, by example, that diverse network configurations are not always beneficial for network security in terms of penetrability.  }
Paper 6:
Title: efficient minimum-cost network hardening via exploit dependency graphs
Abstract: In-depth analysis of network security vulnerabilitymust consider attacker exploits not just in isolation, butalso in combination. The general approach to thisproblem is to compute attack paths (combinations ofexploits), from which one can decide whether a given setof network hardening measures guarantees the safety ofgiven critical resources. We go beyond attack paths tocompute actual sets of hardening measures (assignmentsof initial network conditions) that guarantee the safety ofgiven critical resources. Moreover, for given costsassociated with individual hardening measures, wecompute assignments that minimize overall cost. Bydoing our minimization at the level of initial conditionsrather than exploits, we resolve hardening irrelevanciesand redundancies in a way that cannot be done throughpreviously proposed exploit-level approaches. Also, weuse an efficient exploit-dependency representation basedon monotonic logic that has polynomial complexity, asopposed to many previous attack graph representationshaving exponential complexity.  }
Paper 7:
Title: minimum-cost network hardening using attack graphs
Abstract: In defending one's network against cyber attack, certain vulnerabilities may seem acceptable risks when considered in isolation. But an intruder can often infiltrate a seemingly well-guarded network through a multi-step intrusion, in which each step prepares for the next. Attack graphs can reveal the threat by enumerating possible sequences of exploits that can be followed to compromise given critical resources. However, attack graphs do not directly provide a solution to remove the threat. Finding a solution by hand is error-prone and tedious, particularly for larger and less secure networks whose attack graphs are overly complicated. In this paper, we propose a solution to automate the task of hardening a network against multi-step intrusions. Unlike existing approaches whose solutions require removing exploits, our solution is comprised of initially satisfied conditions only. Our solution is thus more enforceable, because the initial conditions can be independently disabled, whereas exploits are usually consequences of other exploits and hence cannot be disabled without removing the causes. More specifically, we first represent given critical resources as a logic proposition of initial conditions. We then simplify the proposition to make hardening options explicit. Among the options we finally choose solutions with the minimum cost. The key improvements over the preliminary version of this paper include a formal framework of the minimum network hardening problem, and an improved one-pass algorithm in deriving the logic proposition while avoiding logic loops.  }
Paper 8:
Title: managing attack graph complexity through visual hierarchical aggregation
Abstract: We describe a framework for managing network attack graph complexity through interactive visualization, which includes hierarchical aggregation of graph elements. Aggregation collapses non-overlapping subgraphs of the attack graph to single graph vertices, providing compression of attack graph complexity. Our aggregation is recursive (nested), according to a predefined aggregation hierarchy. This hierarchy establishes rules at each level of aggregation, with the rules being based on either common attribute values of attack graph elements or attack graph connectedness. The higher levels of the aggregation hierarchy correspond to higher levels of abstraction, providing progressively summarized visual overviews of the attack graph. We describe rich visual representations that capture relationships among our semantically-relevant attack graph abstractions, and our views support mixtures of elements at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. While it would be possible to allow arbitrary nested aggregation of graph elements, it is better to constrain aggregation according to the semantics of the network attack problem, i.e., according to our aggregation hierarchy. The aggregation hierarchy also makes efficient automatic aggregation possible. We introduce the novel abstraction of protection domain as a level of the aggregation hierarchy, which corresponds to a fully-connected subgraph (clique) of the attack graph. We avoid expensive detection of attack graph cliques through knowledge of the network configuration, i.e. protection domains are predefined. While significant work has been done in automatically generating attack graphs, this is the first treatment of the management of attack graph complexity for interactive visualization. Overall, computation in our framework has worst-case quadratic complexity, but in practice complexity is greatly reduced because users generally interact with (often negligible) subsets of the attack graph. We apply our framework to a real network, using a software system we have developed for generating and visualizing network attack graphs.  }

Epoch:2 | IDEA | Scientist0:Thought: The existing approaches for network hardening and attack graph management have limitations in terms of scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness.

In this thought, we first recognize that existing approaches have limitations. We then propose an idea to address these limitations by introducing Hierarchical Attack Graph Abstraction (HAGA). HAGA represents the network as a set of protection domains, applies recursive aggregation, and develops an efficient algorithm for automatic aggregation.

The high-level plan involves representing the network as protection domains, aggregating non-overlapping subgraphs based on common attribute values or connectedness, developing an efficient algorithm for automatic aggregation, and integrating HAGA with existing network hardening tools. The ideal outcome is a framework that efficiently reduces complexity in attack graph representation, improves network hardening efficiency, and scales well for large networks.

The idea differs from existing ones by addressing the scalability and efficiency limitations of current methods. By using hierarchical abstraction, we can reduce the complexity of attack graphs while preserving relevant information. This allows for more efficient analysis and hardening of networks.

In the experiment section, we outline the methodology, including representing the network as protection domains, applying recursive aggregation, developing an efficient algorithm, and integrating HAGA with existing tools. We also specify the metrics to evaluate the performance of HAGA, such as complexity reduction, improvement in network hardening efficiency, and scalability for large networks.

The ratings for interestingness, feasibility, and novelty are 8, 9, and 7 respectively. This reflects our confidence in the potential impact of HAGA, its practicality, and its innovation compared to existing approaches.

Title: ranking attack graphs
Abstract: A majority of attacks on computer systems result from a combination of vulnerabilities exploited by an intruder to break into the system. An Attack Graph is a general formalism used to model security vulnerabilities of a system and all possible sequences of exploits which an intruder can use to achieve a specific goal. Attack Graphs can be constructed automatically using off-the-shelf model-checking tools. However, for real systems, the size and complexity of Attack Graphs greatly exceeds human ability to visualize, understand and analyze. Therefore, it is useful to identify relevant portions of an Attack Graph. To achieve this, we propose a ranking scheme for the states of an Attack Graph. Rank of a state shows its importance based on factors like the probability of an intruder reaching that state. Given a Ranked Attack Graph, the system administrator can concentrate on relevant subgraphs to figure out how to start deploying security measures. We also define a metric of security of the system based on ranks which the system administrator can use to compare Attack Graphs and determine the effectiveness of various defense measures. We present two algorithms to rank states of an Attack Graph based on the probability of an attacker reaching those states. The first algorithm is similar to the PageRank algorithm used by Google to measure importance of web pages on the World Wide Web. It is flexible enough to model a variety of situations, efficiently computable for large sized graphs and offers the possibility of approximations using graph partitioning. The second algorithm ranks individual states based on the reachability probability of an attacker in a random simulation. Finally, we give examples of an application of ranking techniques to multi-stage cyber attacks.  }

Title: foundations of attack trees
Abstract: Attack trees have found their way to practice because they have proved to be an intuitive aid in threat analysis. Despite, or perhaps thanks to, their apparent simplicity, they have not yet been provided with an unambiguous semantics. We argue that such a formal interpretation is indispensable to precisely understand how attack trees can be manipulated during construction and analysis. We provide a denotational semantics, based on a mapping to attack suites, which abstracts from the internal structure of an attack tree, we study transformations between attack trees, and we study the attribution and projection of an attack tree.  }

Paper 5:
Title: two formal analys s of attack graphs
Abstract: An attack graph is a succinct representation of all paths through a system that end in a state where an intruder has successfully achieved his goal. Today Red Teams determine the vulnerability of networked systems by drawing gigantic attack graphs by hand. Constructing attack graphs by hand is tedious, error-prone, and impractical for large systems. By viewing an attack as a violation of a safety property, we can use off-the-shelf model checking technology to produce attack graphs automatically: a successful path from the intruder's viewpoint is a counterexample produced by the model checker. In this paper we present an algorithm for generating attack graphs using model checking as a sub-routine.Security analysts use attack graphs for detection, defense and forensics. In this paper we present a minimization analysis technique that allows analysts to decide which minimal set of security measures would guarantee the safety of the system. We provide a formal characterization of this problem: we prove that it is polynomially equivalent to the minimum hitting set problem and we present a greedy algorithm with provable bounds. We also present a reliability analysis technique that allows analysts to perform a simple cost-benefit trade-off depending on the likelihoods of attacks. By interpreting attack graphs as Markov Decision Processes we can use the value iteration algorithm to compute the probabilities of intruder success for each attack the graph.  }

Title: scalable, graph-based network vulnerability analysis
Abstract: Even well administered networks are vulnerable to attack. Recent work in network security has focused on the fact that combinations of exploits are the typical means by which an attacker breaks into a network. Researchers have proposed a variety of graph-based algorithms to generate attack trees (or graphs). Either structure represents all possible sequences of exploits, where any given exploit can take advantage of the penetration achieved by prior exploits in its chain, and the final exploit in the chain achieves the attacker's goal. The most recent approach in this line of work uses a modified version of the model checker NuSMV as a powerful inference engine for chaining together network exploits, compactly representing attack graphs, and identifying minimal sets of exploits. However, it is also well known that model checkers suffer from scalability problems, and there is good reason to doubt whether a model checker can handle directly a realistic set of exploits for even a modest-sized network. In this paper, we revisit the idea of attack graphs themselves, and argue that they represent more information explicitly than is necessary for the analyst. Instead, we propose a more compact and scalable representation. Although we show that it is possible to produce attack trees from our representation, we argue that more useful information can be produced, for larger networks, while bypassing the attack tree step. Our approach relies on an explicit assumption of monotonicity, which, in essence, states that the precondition of a given exploit is never invalidated by the successful application of another exploit. In other words, the attacker never needs to backtrack. The assumption reduces the complexity of the analysis problem from exponential to polynomial, thereby bringing even very large networks within reach of analysis  }

Epoch:2 | IDEA | Scientist0:Here's my response:

**Thought:**

The existing literature on attack graph generation and analysis has primarily focused on developing algorithms that can efficiently generate and analyze large-scale attack graphs. However, these approaches often rely on oversimplified models of network behavior and may not accurately capture the complexities of real-world networks. Moreover, most existing methods focus on generating attack graphs as a one-time process, without considering the dynamic nature of modern networks, where new vulnerabilities and exploits are constantly emerging.

In this context, I propose an idea that addresses the limitations of current approaches by developing a more comprehensive and adaptive framework for attack graph generation and analysis.

**In AAGGA, first briefly discuss your intuitions and motivations for the idea.**

My intuition behind AAGGA is that existing approaches to attack graph generation and analysis are too static and do not effectively capture the dynamic nature of modern networks. By integrating machine learning algorithms and developing a dynamic model of network behavior, we can generate more accurate and up-to-date attack graphs that reflect the evolving landscape of vulnerabilities and exploits.

**Detail your high-level plan, necessary design choices, and ideal outcomes of the experiments.**

The high-level plan for AAGGA involves three main components:

1. **Machine learning-based vulnerability prediction**: Integrate machine learning algorithms to predict emerging vulnerabilities and exploits in real-time.
2. **Dynamic network modeling**: Develop a dynamic model of network behavior that can capture evolving relationships between nodes and edges.
3. **Hybrid attack graph generation**: Use a hybrid approach combining symbolic and numerical methods for efficient attack graph generation.

The necessary design choices include:

* Selecting the most suitable machine learning algorithms for vulnerability prediction (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
* Developing a dynamic model that can effectively capture evolving network behavior.
* Choosing the optimal combination of symbolic and numerical methods for hybrid attack graph generation.

Ideal outcomes of the experiments include:

* Improved accuracy in attack graph generation due to real-time data on emerging vulnerabilities and exploits.
* Enhanced scalability of AAGGA, enabling it to handle large-scale networks with reduced computational overhead.
* Increased situational awareness for network defenders through up-to-date information on potential attack paths.

**Justify how the idea is different from the existing ones.**

AAGGA differs from existing approaches in several ways:

* **Dynamic modeling**: Unlike static models used in current attack graph generation tools, AAGGA incorporates a dynamic model that captures evolving relationships between nodes and edges.
* **Machine learning-based vulnerability prediction**: By integrating machine learning algorithms, AAGGA can predict emerging vulnerabilities and exploits in real-time, providing more accurate and up-to-date information for attack graph generation.
* **Hybrid approach**: The hybrid method used in AAGGA combines symbolic and numerical methods for efficient attack graph generation, offering improved scalability and accuracy.

Overall, AAGGA offers a novel and comprehensive framework for attack graph generation and analysis that addresses the limitations of current approaches.

Title: managing attack graph complexity through visual hierarchical aggregation
Abstract: We describe a framework for managing network attack graph complexity through interactive visualization, which includes hierarchical aggregation of graph elements. Aggregation collapses non-overlapping subgraphs of the attack graph to single graph vertices, providing compression of attack graph complexity. Our aggregation is recursive (nested), according to a predefined aggregation hierarchy. This hierarchy establishes rules at each level of aggregation, with the rules being based on either common attribute values of attack graph elements or attack graph connectedness. The higher levels of the aggregation hierarchy correspond to higher levels of abstraction, providing progressively summarized visual overviews of the attack graph. We describe rich visual representations that capture relationships among our semantically-relevant attack graph abstractions, and our views support mixtures of elements at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. While it would be possible to allow arbitrary nested aggregation of graph elements, it is better to constrain aggregation according to the semantics of the network attack problem, i.e., according to our aggregation hierarchy. The aggregation hierarchy also makes efficient automatic aggregation possible. We introduce the novel abstraction of protection domain as a level of the aggregation hierarchy, which corresponds to a fully-connected subgraph (clique) of the attack graph. We avoid expensive detection of attack graph cliques through knowledge of the network configuration, i.e. protection domains are predefined. While significant work has been done in automatically generating attack graphs, this is the first treatment of the management of attack graph complexity for interactive visualization. Overall, computation in our framework has worst-case quadratic complexity, but in practice complexity is greatly reduced because users generally interact with (often negligible) subsets of the attack graph. We apply our framework to a real network, using a software system we have developed for generating and visualizing network attack graphs.  }

Title: an attack graph-based probabilistic security metric
Abstract: To protect critical resources in today's networked environments, it is desirable to quantify the likelihood of potential multi-step attacks that combine multiple vulnerabilities. This now becomes feasible due to a model of causal relationships between vulnerabilities, namely, attack graph. This paper proposes an attack graph-based probabilistic metric for network security and studies its efficient computation. We first define the basic metric and provide an intuitive and meaningful interpretation to the metric. We then study the definition in more complex attack graphs with cycles and extend the definition accordingly. We show that computing the metric directly from its definition is not efficient in many cases and propose heuristics to improve the efficiency of such computation.  }

Title: practical attack graph generation for network defense
Abstract: Attack graphs are a valuable tool to network defenders, illustrating paths an attacker can use to gain access to a targeted network. Defenders can then focus their efforts on patching the vulnerabilities and configuration errors that allow the attackers the greatest amount of access. We have created a new type of attack graph, the multiple-prerequisite graph, that scales nearly linearly as the size of a typical network increases. We have built a prototype system using this graph type. The prototype uses readily available source data to automatically compute network reachability, classify vulnerabilities, build the graph, and recommend actions to improve network security. We have tested the prototype on an operational network with over 250 hosts, where it helped to discover a previously unknown configuration error. It has processed complex simulated networks with over 50,000 hosts in under four minutes.  }

Title: ranking attack graphs
Abstract: A majority of attacks on computer systems result from a combination of vulnerabilities exploited by an intruder to break into the system. An Attack Graph is a general formalism used to model security vulnerabilities of a system and all possible sequences of exploits which an intruder can use to achieve a specific goal. Attack Graphs can be constructed automatically using off-the-shelf model-checking tools. However, for real systems, the size and complexity of Attack Graphs greatly exceeds human ability to visualize, understand and analyze. Therefore, it is useful to identify relevant portions of an Attack Graph. To achieve this, we propose a ranking scheme for the states of an Attack Graph. Rank of a state shows its importance based on factors like the probability of an intruder reaching that state. Given a Ranked Attack Graph, the system administrator can concentrate on relevant subgraphs to figure out how to start deploying security measures. We also define a metric of security of the system based on ranks which the system administrator can use to compare Attack Graphs and determine the effectiveness of various defense measures. We present two algorithms to rank states of an Attack Graph based on the probability of an attacker reaching those states. The first algorithm is similar to the PageRank algorithm used by Google to measure importance of web pages on the World Wide Web. It is flexible enough to model a variety of situations, efficiently computable for large sized graphs and offers the possibility of approximations using graph partitioning. The second algorithm ranks individual states based on the reachability probability of an attacker in a random simulation. Finally, we give examples of an application of ranking techniques to multi-stage cyber attacks.  }
Paper 6:
Title: scalable, graph-based network vulnerability analysis
Abstract: Even well administered networks are vulnerable to attack. Recent work in network security has focused on the fact that combinations of exploits are the typical means by which an attacker breaks into a network. Researchers have proposed a variety of graph-based algorithms to generate attack trees (or graphs). Either structure represents all possible sequences of exploits, where any given exploit can take advantage of the penetration achieved by prior exploits in its chain, and the final exploit in the chain achieves the attacker's goal. The most recent approach in this line of work uses a modified version of the model checker NuSMV as a powerful inference engine for chaining together network exploits, compactly representing attack graphs, and identifying minimal sets of exploits. However, it is also well known that model checkers suffer from scalability problems, and there is good reason to doubt whether a model checker can handle directly a realistic set of exploits for even a modest-sized network. In this paper, we revisit the idea of attack graphs themselves, and argue that they represent more information explicitly than is necessary for the analyst. Instead, we propose a more compact and scalable representation. Although we show that it is possible to produce attack trees from our representation, we argue that more useful information can be produced, for larger networks, while bypassing the attack tree step. Our approach relies on an explicit assumption of monotonicity, which, in essence, states that the precondition of a given exploit is never invalidated by the successful application of another exploit. In other words, the attacker never needs to backtrack. The assumption reduces the complexity of the analysis problem from exponential to polynomial, thereby bringing even very large networks within reach of analysis  }

Title: automated generation and analysis of attack graphs
Abstract: An integral part of modeling the global view of network security isconstructing attack graphs.In practice, attack graphs areproduced manually by Red Teams.Construction by hand, however, istedious, error-prone, and impractical for attack graphs larger than ahundred nodes.In this paper we present an automated technique forgenerating and analyzing attack graphs.We base our technique onsymbolic model checking algorithms,letting us construct attack graphs automatically and efficiently.Wealso describe two analyses to help decide which attacks would be mostcost-effective to guard against.We implemented our technique in atool suite and tested it on a small network example, which includesmodels of a firewall and an intrusion detection system.  }

Title: how to explore a fast-changing world (cover time of a simple random walk on evolving graphs)
Abstract: Motivated by real world networks and use of algorithms based on random walks on these networks we study the simple random walks on dynamic undirected graphs with fixed underlying vertex set, i.e., graphs which are modified by inserting or deleting edges at every step of the walk. We are interested in the expected time needed to visit all the vertices of such a dynamic graph, the cover time, under the assumption that the graph is being modified by an oblivious adversary. It is well known that on connected static undirected graphs the cover time is polynomial in the size of the graph. On the contrary and somewhat counter-intuitively, we show that there are adversary strategies which force the expected cover time of a simple random walk on connected dynamic graphs to be exponential. We relate this result to the cover time of static directed graphs. In addition we provide a simple strategy, the lazy random walk, that guarantees polynomial cover time regardless of the changes made by the adversary.  }

Epoch:2 | IDEA | Scientist0:Thought: I'd like to propose an idea that combines the concepts of attack graphs and random walks to analyze network security in a more efficient and scalable way.

My intuition for this idea comes from papers 6 and 8, which discuss the limitations of using model checkers and traditional attack graph approaches. Paper 6 proposes a compact representation of attack graphs, while paper 8 explores the concept of simple random walks on dynamic graphs. I believe that by combining these ideas, we can create a more efficient and scalable approach to analyzing network security.

My high-level plan is to develop an algorithm that uses a compact representation of attack graphs (similar to paper 6) and incorporates random walks to efficiently explore the graph. The idea is to start with a random node in the graph and perform a random walk, exploring the graph and identifying potential vulnerabilities. By using a compact representation of the graph, we can reduce the computational complexity of the analysis.

One key design choice will be to determine how to incorporate the monotonicity assumption (as discussed in paper 6) into our algorithm. This assumption states that the precondition of a given exploit is never invalidated by the successful application of another exploit. By assuming monotonicity, we can reduce the complexity of the analysis problem from exponential to polynomial.

Ideal outcomes of the experiments would be to demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our approach compared to traditional attack graph methods. We should also investigate how well our algorithm performs in identifying potential vulnerabilities in dynamic graphs (as discussed in paper 8).

This idea is different from existing ones because it combines two distinct concepts: compact representations of attack graphs and random walks on dynamic graphs. By doing so, we can create a more efficient and scalable approach to analyzing network security.

Title: many random walks are faster than one
Abstract: We pose a new and intriguing question motivated by distributed computing regarding random walks on graphs: How long does it take for several independent random walks, starting from the same vertex, to cover an entire graph? We study the cover time - the expected time required to visit every node in a graph at least once - and we show that for a large collection of interesting graphs, running many random walks in parallel yields a speed-up in the cover time that is linear in the number of parallel walks. We demonstrate that an exponential speed-up is sometimes possible, but that some natural graphs allow only a logarithmic speed-up. A problem related to ours (in which the walks start from some probablistic distribution on vertices) was previously studied in the context of space efficient algorithms for undirected s-t-connectivity and our results yield, in certain cases, an improvement upon some of the earlier bounds.  }

Title: foundations of attack trees
Abstract: Attack trees have found their way to practice because they have proved to be an intuitive aid in threat analysis. Despite, or perhaps thanks to, their apparent simplicity, they have not yet been provided with an unambiguous semantics. We argue that such a formal interpretation is indispensable to precisely understand how attack trees can be manipulated during construction and analysis. We provide a denotational semantics, based on a mapping to attack suites, which abstracts from the internal structure of an attack tree, we study transformations between attack trees, and we study the attribution and projection of an attack tree.  }

Title: peer-to-peer networks based on random transformations of connected regular undirected graphs
Abstract: We present k-Flipper, a graph transformation algorithmthat transforms regular undirected graphs. Given a path ofk+2 edges it interchanges the end vertices of the path. Bydefinition this operation preserves regularity and connectivity. Weshow that every regular connected graph can be reached by a seriesof these operations for all k ¡Ý 1. We use arandomized version, called Random k-Flipper, in order tocreate random regular connected undirected graphs that may serve asa backbone for peer-to-peer networks. We prove for degreed¡Ê ¦¸(log n) that a seriesof O(dn) Random k-Flipper operations withk ∈¦¨(d2n2 log1/¦Å) transforms any graph into an expander graph withhigh probability, i.e. 1-n-¦¨(1).The Random 1-Flipper is symmetric, i.e. the transformationprobability from any labeled d-regular graphG to G' is equal to thosefrom G' to G. From this andthe reachability property we conclude that in the limit a series ofRandom 1-Flipper operations converges against an uniformprobability distribution over all connected labeledd-regular graphs. For degreed ∈ ω(1) growing with the graph sizethis implies that iteratively applying Random 1-Flipper transformsany given graph into an expander asymptotically almost surely.We use these operations as a maintenance operation for apeer-to-peer network based on random regular connected graphs thatprovides high robustness and recovers from degenerate networkstructures by continuously applying these random graphtransformations. For this, we describe how network operations forjoining and leaving the network can be designed and how theconcurrency of the graph transformations can be handled.  }

Title: a doubling dimension threshold θ(loglogn) for augmented graph navigability
Abstract: In his seminal work, Kleinberg showed how to augment meshes using random edges, so that they become navigable; that is, greedy routing computes paths of polylogarithmic expected length between any pairs of nodes. This yields the crucial question of determining wether such an augmentation is possible for all graphs. In this paper, we answer negatively to this question by exhibiting a threshold on the doubling dimension, above which an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable whatever the distribution of random edges is. Precisely, it was known that graphs of doubling dimension at most O (loglogn) are navigable. We show that for doubling dimension ≫loglogn, an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable. Finally, we complete our result by studying the special case of square meshes, that we prove to always be augmentable to become navigable.  }

Epoch:3 | ABSTRACT | Scientist0:THOUGHT: Based on the provided abstracts, it seems that Papers 6 and 8 are related to network security and attack graphs. Paper 7 discusses graph navigability and augmentation, which might be tangentially relevant but doesn't seem directly connected to network security or attack graphs. Paper 5 appears to discuss a random graph transformation for peer-to-peer networks, which also relates to network security but in a different context.

Explanation:
- Idea 0 corresponds to selecting the best research paper among the four that directly contributes to solving real-world problems related to network security and attack graphs.
- Paper 6 presents a practical solution for generating attack graphs, which is crucial for network defense. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on an operational network with over 250 hosts.
- Paper 8 proposes a ranking scheme for states in attack graphs, enabling system administrators to focus on relevant portions of the graph and measure security based on ranks. This is highly applicable in real-world scenarios where the complexity of attack graphs makes manual analysis impractical.
- While Papers 5 and 7 are interesting in their own right, they don't as directly address the core issues of network security and attack graphs as Papers 6 and 8 do.

Therefore, based on relevance to solving real-world problems related to network security and attack graphs, I select Idea 0.

Title: managing attack graph complexity through visual hierarchical aggregation
Abstract: We describe a framework for managing network attack graph complexity through interactive visualization, which includes hierarchical aggregation of graph elements. Aggregation collapses non-overlapping subgraphs of the attack graph to single graph vertices, providing compression of attack graph complexity. Our aggregation is recursive (nested), according to a predefined aggregation hierarchy. This hierarchy establishes rules at each level of aggregation, with the rules being based on either common attribute values of attack graph elements or attack graph connectedness. The higher levels of the aggregation hierarchy correspond to higher levels of abstraction, providing progressively summarized visual overviews of the attack graph. We describe rich visual representations that capture relationships among our semantically-relevant attack graph abstractions, and our views support mixtures of elements at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. While it would be possible to allow arbitrary nested aggregation of graph elements, it is better to constrain aggregation according to the semantics of the network attack problem, i.e., according to our aggregation hierarchy. The aggregation hierarchy also makes efficient automatic aggregation possible. We introduce the novel abstraction of protection domain as a level of the aggregation hierarchy, which corresponds to a fully-connected subgraph (clique) of the attack graph. We avoid expensive detection of attack graph cliques through knowledge of the network configuration, i.e. protection domains are predefined. While significant work has been done in automatically generating attack graphs, this is the first treatment of the management of attack graph complexity for interactive visualization. Overall, computation in our framework has worst-case quadratic complexity, but in practice complexity is greatly reduced because users generally interact with (often negligible) subsets of the attack graph. We apply our framework to a real network, using a software system we have developed for generating and visualizing network attack graphs.  }

Title: an attack graph-based probabilistic security metric
Abstract: To protect critical resources in today's networked environments, it is desirable to quantify the likelihood of potential multi-step attacks that combine multiple vulnerabilities. This now becomes feasible due to a model of causal relationships between vulnerabilities, namely, attack graph. This paper proposes an attack graph-based probabilistic metric for network security and studies its efficient computation. We first define the basic metric and provide an intuitive and meaningful interpretation to the metric. We then study the definition in more complex attack graphs with cycles and extend the definition accordingly. We show that computing the metric directly from its definition is not efficient in many cases and propose heuristics to improve the efficiency of such computation.  }

Title: many random walks are faster than one
Abstract: We pose a new and intriguing question motivated by distributed computing regarding random walks on graphs: How long does it take for several independent random walks, starting from the same vertex, to cover an entire graph? We study the cover time - the expected time required to visit every node in a graph at least once - and we show that for a large collection of interesting graphs, running many random walks in parallel yields a speed-up in the cover time that is linear in the number of parallel walks. We demonstrate that an exponential speed-up is sometimes possible, but that some natural graphs allow only a logarithmic speed-up. A problem related to ours (in which the walks start from some probablistic distribution on vertices) was previously studied in the context of space efficient algorithms for undirected s-t-connectivity and our results yield, in certain cases, an improvement upon some of the earlier bounds.  }

Title: foundations of attack trees
Abstract: Attack trees have found their way to practice because they have proved to be an intuitive aid in threat analysis. Despite, or perhaps thanks to, their apparent simplicity, they have not yet been provided with an unambiguous semantics. We argue that such a formal interpretation is indispensable to precisely understand how attack trees can be manipulated during construction and analysis. We provide a denotational semantics, based on a mapping to attack suites, which abstracts from the internal structure of an attack tree, we study transformations between attack trees, and we study the attribution and projection of an attack tree.  }

Title: peer-to-peer networks based on random transformations of connected regular undirected graphs
Abstract: We present k-Flipper, a graph transformation algorithmthat transforms regular undirected graphs. Given a path ofk+2 edges it interchanges the end vertices of the path. Bydefinition this operation preserves regularity and connectivity. Weshow that every regular connected graph can be reached by a seriesof these operations for all k ¡Ý 1. We use arandomized version, called Random k-Flipper, in order tocreate random regular connected undirected graphs that may serve asa backbone for peer-to-peer networks. We prove for degreed¡Ê ¦¸(log n) that a seriesof O(dn) Random k-Flipper operations withk ∈¦¨(d2n2 log1/¦Å) transforms any graph into an expander graph withhigh probability, i.e. 1-n-¦¨(1).The Random 1-Flipper is symmetric, i.e. the transformationprobability from any labeled d-regular graphG to G' is equal to thosefrom G' to G. From this andthe reachability property we conclude that in the limit a series ofRandom 1-Flipper operations converges against an uniformprobability distribution over all connected labeledd-regular graphs. For degreed ∈ ω(1) growing with the graph sizethis implies that iteratively applying Random 1-Flipper transformsany given graph into an expander asymptotically almost surely.We use these operations as a maintenance operation for apeer-to-peer network based on random regular connected graphs thatprovides high robustness and recovers from degenerate networkstructures by continuously applying these random graphtransformations. For this, we describe how network operations forjoining and leaving the network can be designed and how theconcurrency of the graph transformations can be handled.  }

Title: practical attack graph generation for network defense
Abstract: Attack graphs are a valuable tool to network defenders, illustrating paths an attacker can use to gain access to a targeted network. Defenders can then focus their efforts on patching the vulnerabilities and configuration errors that allow the attackers the greatest amount of access. We have created a new type of attack graph, the multiple-prerequisite graph, that scales nearly linearly as the size of a typical network increases. We have built a prototype system using this graph type. The prototype uses readily available source data to automatically compute network reachability, classify vulnerabilities, build the graph, and recommend actions to improve network security. We have tested the prototype on an operational network with over 250 hosts, where it helped to discover a previously unknown configuration error. It has processed complex simulated networks with over 50,000 hosts in under four minutes.  }

Title: a doubling dimension threshold θ(loglogn) for augmented graph navigability
Abstract: In his seminal work, Kleinberg showed how to augment meshes using random edges, so that they become navigable; that is, greedy routing computes paths of polylogarithmic expected length between any pairs of nodes. This yields the crucial question of determining wether such an augmentation is possible for all graphs. In this paper, we answer negatively to this question by exhibiting a threshold on the doubling dimension, above which an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable whatever the distribution of random edges is. Precisely, it was known that graphs of doubling dimension at most O (loglogn) are navigable. We show that for doubling dimension ≫loglogn, an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable. Finally, we complete our result by studying the special case of square meshes, that we prove to always be augmentable to become navigable.  }

Title: ranking attack graphs
Abstract: A majority of attacks on computer systems result from a combination of vulnerabilities exploited by an intruder to break into the system. An Attack Graph is a general formalism used to model security vulnerabilities of a system and all possible sequences of exploits which an intruder can use to achieve a specific goal. Attack Graphs can be constructed automatically using off-the-shelf model-checking tools. However, for real systems, the size and complexity of Attack Graphs greatly exceeds human ability to visualize, understand and analyze. Therefore, it is useful to identify relevant portions of an Attack Graph. To achieve this, we propose a ranking scheme for the states of an Attack Graph. Rank of a state shows its importance based on factors like the probability of an intruder reaching that state. Given a Ranked Attack Graph, the system administrator can concentrate on relevant subgraphs to figure out how to start deploying security measures. We also define a metric of security of the system based on ranks which the system administrator can use to compare Attack Graphs and determine the effectiveness of various defense measures. We present two algorithms to rank states of an Attack Graph based on the probability of an attacker reaching those states. The first algorithm is similar to the PageRank algorithm used by Google to measure importance of web pages on the World Wide Web. It is flexible enough to model a variety of situations, efficiently computable for large sized graphs and offers the possibility of approximations using graph partitioning. The second algorithm ranks individual states based on the reachability probability of an attacker in a random simulation. Finally, we give examples of an application of ranking techniques to multi-stage cyber attacks.  }

Epoch:3 | ABSTRACT | Scientist0:THOUGHT: Based on the provided abstracts, it seems that Papers 6 and 8 are related to network security and graph theory. Paper 7 also deals with graph theory but focuses on navigability. However, Paper 1 appears to be unrelated as it discusses a specific algorithm (Random 1-Flipper) for transforming graphs into expanders.

Paper 6 proposes a new type of attack graph that scales well with the size of a network and provides a prototype system to automatically compute network reachability and classify vulnerabilities. This is relevant to network security, which seems to be a common theme among these papers.

Paper 8 discusses ranking attack graphs, which is also related to network security. The authors propose two algorithms for ranking states in an attack graph based on the probability of an attacker reaching those states.

On the other hand, Paper 7 deals with the navigability of augmented graphs and presents a threshold on the doubling dimension above which an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable. This is more focused on graph theory than network security.

Given this information, I will select Papers 6 and 8 as they are most relevant to network security and have practical implications for defending against cyber attacks.

Paper 6 proposes a new type of attack graph that scales well with the size of a network and provides a prototype system to automatically compute network reachability and classify vulnerabilities. This is relevant to network security, which seems to be a common theme among these papers.

Paper 8 discusses ranking attack graphs, which is also related to network security. The authors propose two algorithms for ranking states in an attack graph based on the probability of an attacker reaching those states.

On the other hand, Paper 7 deals with the navigability of augmented graphs and presents a threshold on the doubling dimension above which an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable. This is more focused on graph theory than network security.

Given this information, I will select Papers 6 and 8 as they are most relevant to network security and have practical implications for defending against cyber attacks.

Title: managing attack graph complexity through visual hierarchical aggregation
Abstract: We describe a framework for managing network attack graph complexity through interactive visualization, which includes hierarchical aggregation of graph elements. Aggregation collapses non-overlapping subgraphs of the attack graph to single graph vertices, providing compression of attack graph complexity. Our aggregation is recursive (nested), according to a predefined aggregation hierarchy. This hierarchy establishes rules at each level of aggregation, with the rules being based on either common attribute values of attack graph elements or attack graph connectedness. The higher levels of the aggregation hierarchy correspond to higher levels of abstraction, providing progressively summarized visual overviews of the attack graph. We describe rich visual representations that capture relationships among our semantically-relevant attack graph abstractions, and our views support mixtures of elements at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. While it would be possible to allow arbitrary nested aggregation of graph elements, it is better to constrain aggregation according to the semantics of the network attack problem, i.e., according to our aggregation hierarchy. The aggregation hierarchy also makes efficient automatic aggregation possible. We introduce the novel abstraction of protection domain as a level of the aggregation hierarchy, which corresponds to a fully-connected subgraph (clique) of the attack graph. We avoid expensive detection of attack graph cliques through knowledge of the network configuration, i.e. protection domains are predefined. While significant work has been done in automatically generating attack graphs, this is the first treatment of the management of attack graph complexity for interactive visualization. Overall, computation in our framework has worst-case quadratic complexity, but in practice complexity is greatly reduced because users generally interact with (often negligible) subsets of the attack graph. We apply our framework to a real network, using a software system we have developed for generating and visualizing network attack graphs.  }
Paper 2:
Title: an attack graph-based probabilistic security metric
Abstract: To protect critical resources in today's networked environments, it is desirable to quantify the likelihood of potential multi-step attacks that combine multiple vulnerabilities. This now becomes feasible due to a model of causal relationships between vulnerabilities, namely, attack graph. This paper proposes an attack graph-based probabilistic metric for network security and studies its efficient computation. We first define the basic metric and provide an intuitive and meaningful interpretation to the metric. We then study the definition in more complex attack graphs with cycles and extend the definition accordingly. We show that computing the metric directly from its definition is not efficient in many cases and propose heuristics to improve the efficiency of such computation.  }
Paper 3:
Title: many random walks are faster than one
Abstract: We pose a new and intriguing question motivated by distributed computing regarding random walks on graphs: How long does it take for several independent random walks, starting from the same vertex, to cover an entire graph? We study the cover time - the expected time required to visit every node in a graph at least once - and we show that for a large collection of interesting graphs, running many random walks in parallel yields a speed-up in the cover time that is linear in the number of parallel walks. We demonstrate that an exponential speed-up is sometimes possible, but that some natural graphs allow only a logarithmic speed-up. A problem related to ours (in which the walks start from some probablistic distribution on vertices) was previously studied in the context of space efficient algorithms for undirected s-t-connectivity and our results yield, in certain cases, an improvement upon some of the earlier bounds.  }
Paper 4:
Title: foundations of attack trees
Abstract: Attack trees have found their way to practice because they have proved to be an intuitive aid in threat analysis. Despite, or perhaps thanks to, their apparent simplicity, they have not yet been provided with an unambiguous semantics. We argue that such a formal interpretation is indispensable to precisely understand how attack trees can be manipulated during construction and analysis. We provide a denotational semantics, based on a mapping to attack suites, which abstracts from the internal structure of an attack tree, we study transformations between attack trees, and we study the attribution and projection of an attack tree.  }
Paper 5:
Title: peer-to-peer networks based on random transformations of connected regular undirected graphs
Abstract: We present k-Flipper, a graph transformation algorithmthat transforms regular undirected graphs. Given a path ofk+2 edges it interchanges the end vertices of the path. Bydefinition this operation preserves regularity and connectivity. Weshow that every regular connected graph can be reached by a seriesof these operations for all k ¡Ý 1. We use arandomized version, called Random k-Flipper, in order tocreate random regular connected undirected graphs that may serve asa backbone for peer-to-peer networks. We prove for degreed¡Ê ¦¸(log n) that a seriesof O(dn) Random k-Flipper operations withk ∈¦¨(d2n2 log1/¦Å) transforms any graph into an expander graph withhigh probability, i.e. 1-n-¦¨(1).The Random 1-Flipper is symmetric, i.e. the transformationprobability from any labeled d-regular graphG to G' is equal to thosefrom G' to G. From this andthe reachability property we conclude that in the limit a series ofRandom 1-Flipper operations converges against an uniformprobability distribution over all connected labeledd-regular graphs. For degreed ∈ ω(1) growing with the graph sizethis implies that iteratively applying Random 1-Flipper transformsany given graph into an expander asymptotically almost surely.We use these operations as a maintenance operation for apeer-to-peer network based on random regular connected graphs thatprovides high robustness and recovers from degenerate networkstructures by continuously applying these random graphtransformations. For this, we describe how network operations forjoining and leaving the network can be designed and how theconcurrency of the graph transformations can be handled.  }
Paper 6:
Title: practical attack graph generation for network defense
Abstract: Attack graphs are a valuable tool to network defenders, illustrating paths an attacker can use to gain access to a targeted network. Defenders can then focus their efforts on patching the vulnerabilities and configuration errors that allow the attackers the greatest amount of access. We have created a new type of attack graph, the multiple-prerequisite graph, that scales nearly linearly as the size of a typical network increases. We have built a prototype system using this graph type. The prototype uses readily available source data to automatically compute network reachability, classify vulnerabilities, build the graph, and recommend actions to improve network security. We have tested the prototype on an operational network with over 250 hosts, where it helped to discover a previously unknown configuration error. It has processed complex simulated networks with over 50,000 hosts in under four minutes.  }

Title: a doubling dimension threshold θ(loglogn) for augmented graph navigability
Abstract: In his seminal work, Kleinberg showed how to augment meshes using random edges, so that they become navigable; that is, greedy routing computes paths of polylogarithmic expected length between any pairs of nodes. This yields the crucial question of determining wether such an augmentation is possible for all graphs. In this paper, we answer negatively to this question by exhibiting a threshold on the doubling dimension, above which an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable whatever the distribution of random edges is. Precisely, it was known that graphs of doubling dimension at most O (loglogn) are navigable. We show that for doubling dimension ≫loglogn, an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable. Finally, we complete our result by studying the special case of square meshes, that we prove to always be augmentable to become navigable.  }
Paper 8:
Title: ranking attack graphs
Abstract: A majority of attacks on computer systems result from a combination of vulnerabilities exploited by an intruder to break into the system. An Attack Graph is a general formalism used to model security vulnerabilities of a system and all possible sequences of exploits which an intruder can use to achieve a specific goal. Attack Graphs can be constructed automatically using off-the-shelf model-checking tools. However, for real systems, the size and complexity of Attack Graphs greatly exceeds human ability to visualize, understand and analyze. Therefore, it is useful to identify relevant portions of an Attack Graph. To achieve this, we propose a ranking scheme for the states of an Attack Graph. Rank of a state shows its importance based on factors like the probability of an intruder reaching that state. Given a Ranked Attack Graph, the system administrator can concentrate on relevant subgraphs to figure out how to start deploying security measures. We also define a metric of security of the system based on ranks which the system administrator can use to compare Attack Graphs and determine the effectiveness of various defense measures. We present two algorithms to rank states of an Attack Graph based on the probability of an attacker reaching those states. The first algorithm is similar to the PageRank algorithm used by Google to measure importance of web pages on the World Wide Web. It is flexible enough to model a variety of situations, efficiently computable for large sized graphs and offers the possibility of approximations using graph partitioning. The second algorithm ranks individual states based on the reachability probability of an attacker in a random simulation. Finally, we give examples of an application of ranking techniques to multi-stage cyber attacks.  }

Then, we propose\na cost-effective anchor-picking policy to pick the most promising anchors for\nadding or removing edges, and a more aggressive iterative greedy-based attack\nmethod to perform more efficient attacks.

The general approach to thisproblem is to compute attack paths (combinations ofexploits), from which one can decide whether a given setof network hardening measures guarantees the safety ofgiven critical resources. We go beyond attack paths tocompute actual sets of hardening measures (assignmentsof initial network conditions) that guarantee the safety ofgiven critical resources. Moreover, for given costsassociated with individual hardening measures, wecompute assignments that minimize overall cost. Bydoing our minimization at the level of initial conditionsrather than exploits, we resolve hardening irrelevanciesand redundancies in a way that cannot be done throughpreviously proposed exploit-level approaches. Also, weuse an efficient exploit-dependency representation basedon monotonic logic that has polynomial complexity, asopposed to many previous attack graph representationshaving exponential complexity.  '}, {'title': 'minimum-cost network hardening using attack graphs', 'abstract': "In defending one's network against cyber attack, certain vulnerabilities may seem acceptable risks when considered in isolation. But an intruder can often infiltrate a seemingly well-guarded network through a multi-step intrusion, in which each step prepares for the next. Attack graphs can reveal the threat by enumerating possible sequences of exploits that can be followed to compromise given critical resources. However, attack graphs do not directly provide a solution to remove the threat. Finding a solution by hand is error-prone and tedious, particularly for larger and less secure networks whose attack graphs are overly complicated. In this paper, we propose a solution to automate the task of hardening a network against multi-step intrusions. Unlike existing approaches whose solutions require removing exploits, our solution is comprised of initially satisfied conditions only. Our solution is thus more enforceable, because the initial conditions can be independently disabled, whereas exploits are usually consequences of other exploits and hence cannot be disabled without removing the causes. More specifically, we first represent given critical resources as a logic proposition of initial conditions. We then simplify the proposition to make hardening options explicit. Among the options we finally choose solutions with the minimum cost. The key improvements over the preliminary version of this paper include a formal framework of the minimum network hardening problem, and an improved one-pass algorithm in deriving the logic proposition while avoiding logic loops.

Defenders can then focus their efforts on patching the vulnerabilities and configuration errors that allow the attackers the greatest amount of access. We have created a new type of attack graph, the multiple-prerequisite graph, that scales nearly linearly as the size of a typical network increases. We have built a prototype system using this graph type. The prototype uses readily available source data to automatically compute network reachability, classify vulnerabilities, build the graph, and recommend actions to improve network security. We have tested the prototype on an operational network with over 250 hosts, where it helped to discover a previously unknown configuration error. It has processed complex simulated networks with over 50,000 hosts in under four minutes.

Aggregation collapses non-overlapping subgraphs of the attack graph to single graph vertices, providing compression of attack graph complexity. Our aggregation is recursive (nested), according to a predefined aggregation hierarchy. This hierarchy establishes rules at each level of aggregation, with the rules being based on either common attribute values of attack graph elements or attack graph connectedness. The higher levels of the aggregation hierarchy correspond to higher levels of abstraction, providing progressively summarized visual overviews of the attack graph. We describe rich visual representations that capture relationships among our semantically-relevant attack graph abstractions, and our views support mixtures of elements at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. While it would be possible to allow arbitrary nested aggregation of graph elements, it is better to constrain aggregation according to the semantics of the network attack problem, i.e., according to our aggregation hierarchy. The aggregation hierarchy also makes efficient automatic aggregation possible. We introduce the novel abstraction of protection domain as a level of the aggregation hierarchy, which corresponds to a fully-connected subgraph (clique) of the attack graph. We avoid expensive detection of attack graph cliques through knowledge of the network configuration, i.e. protection domains are predefined. While significant work has been done in automatically generating attack graphs, this is the first treatment of the management of attack graph complexity for interactive visualization. Overall, computation in our framework has worst-case quadratic complexity, but in practice complexity is greatly reduced because users generally interact with (often negligible) subsets of the attack graph. We apply our framework to a real network, using a software system we have developed for generating and visualizing network attack graphs.  '}]

Here's a brief explanation of each similarity score:

* Written Abstract vs A: **60** - Both abstracts discuss attack graphs and their application in network defense. The written abstract shares similarities with A in terms of content (e.g., discussing the importance of patching vulnerabilities) but differs in its focus on automating network hardening.
* Written Abstract vs B: **40** - This pair has a lower similarity score because B introduces a new type of attack graph (multiple-prerequisite graph), which is not mentioned in the written abstract. While both discuss attack graphs, their content and structure differ significantly.
* Written Abstract vs C: **30** - As mentioned earlier, this pair has a relatively low similarity score due to differences in focus. The written abstract discusses automating network hardening, whereas A focuses on using attack graphs as a tool for network defenders.
* Written Abstract vs D: **20** - This pair has the lowest similarity score among all comparisons. D introduces a new type of attack graph (multiple-prerequisite graph), which is not related to the written abstract's focus on automating network hardening.
* Written Abstract vs E: **80** - Both abstracts discuss attack graphs and their application in network defense, with similar content and structure.
* Written Abstract vs F: **50** - This pair has a moderate similarity score because both discuss managing attack graph complexity. However, A focuses on visual hierarchical aggregation as a solution, while F describes a framework for interactive visualization and aggregation.
* Written Abstract vs G: **70** - Both abstracts share similarities in terms of content (e.g., discussing the importance of patching vulnerabilities) but differ in their focus on automating network hardening.
* Written Abstract vs H: **90** - This pair has the highest similarity score due to identical content, structure, and phrasing.

The high_overlap_pairs section highlights areas where the written abstract and corresponding A-H abstracts have significant overlap or differences.
