Epoch:0 | TOPIC | Scientist0:It's great to be part of this team! I'm excited to dive into some collaborative discussions.

As Scientist0, I've worked extensively in data-related research areas such as data cube, attack graph, and access control. Given our team's strengths, I'd like to propose a potential research topic that combines data security with the expertise of Scientist48.

Have you considered exploring the intersection of data protection and Semantic Web? With Scientist48's experience in knowledge bases and multi-agent systems, we could investigate how to develop a more robust and secure way to manage and share sensitive information on the Semantic Web. This could involve designing novel access control mechanisms that take into account the complex relationships between users, resources, and permissions.

To make it even more relevant to our team's goals, we could also integrate concepts from data mining and data redundancy to identify potential security vulnerabilities in large-scale data sharing scenarios. By combining these areas of expertise, I believe we could develop innovative solutions for protecting sensitive information while facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing on the Semantic Web.

What are your thoughts on this potential research direction?

Epoch:0 | TOPIC | Scientist121:As Scientist121, I'm intrigued by Scientist0's proposal to explore the intersection of data protection and Semantic Web. It's a fascinating area that combines our team's strengths in data security with Scientist48's expertise in knowledge bases and multi-agent systems.

One potential angle we could take is to investigate how hot-potato routing and interdomain routing principles can be applied to optimize data sharing and access control on the Semantic Web. By analyzing traffic patterns and routing policies, we might be able to identify more efficient ways to manage sensitive information and ensure that it reaches authorized parties while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

Additionally, I'd like to suggest that we consider incorporating concepts from virtual network design to create a more secure and scalable infrastructure for data sharing on the Semantic Web. This could involve developing novel routing protocols that take into account the complex relationships between users, resources, and permissions, as Scientist0 mentioned.

To further refine this research direction, I think it would be helpful to discuss how we can integrate our team's expertise in traffic engineering and backhaul network design with Scientist48's knowledge of multi-agent systems and social networks. By combining these perspectives, we might be able to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges involved in protecting sensitive information on the Semantic Web.

Epoch:0 | TOPIC | Scientist23:Scientist23 here! I'm excited to join the discussion and contribute my expertise to this potential research topic. As Scientist121 mentioned, exploring the intersection of data protection and Semantic Web is a fascinating area that aligns with our team's strengths.

I'd like to build upon the ideas presented by Scientist0 and Scientist121. Specifically, I think we should investigate how schema mapping and standard schema mapping techniques can be applied to optimize data sharing and access control on the Semantic Web. By developing novel methods for mapping complex relationships between users, resources, and permissions, we might be able to create more robust and secure ways to manage sensitive information.

Moreover, I'd like to suggest that we consider incorporating concepts from data exchange and universal solution design to create a more scalable and efficient infrastructure for data sharing on the Semantic Web. This could involve developing novel protocols for exchanging data between different systems while ensuring that sensitive information is properly protected.

To further refine this research direction, I think it would be helpful to discuss how we can integrate our team's expertise in traffic engineering and backhaul network design with Scientist48's knowledge of multi-agent systems and social networks. By combining these perspectives, we might be able to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges involved in protecting sensitive information on the Semantic Web.

Additionally, I'd like to propose that we explore how data redundancy and data mining techniques can be used to identify potential security vulnerabilities in large-scale data sharing scenarios. This could involve developing novel methods for detecting anomalies in data exchange patterns or identifying areas where sensitive information might be compromised.

Epoch:0 | TOPIC | Scientist114:I'm Scientist114, and I'd like to contribute my expertise to this discussion. As a researcher with experience in parallel algorithms, sensor networks, and experimental results, I think we can bring a unique perspective to the intersection of data protection and Semantic Web.

One potential angle that caught my attention is the idea of integrating concepts from virtual network design, as suggested by Scientist121. I'd like to propose taking it a step further by exploring how parallel algorithms can be applied to optimize data sharing and access control on the Semantic Web. By leveraging the power of parallel processing, we might be able to develop more efficient and scalable solutions for managing sensitive information.

Moreover, I think we should also consider incorporating concepts from explicit rate algorithm design to create a more dynamic and adaptive infrastructure for data sharing on the Semantic Web. This could involve developing novel protocols that adjust data transmission rates based on changing network conditions or user preferences.

To further refine this research direction, I'd like to suggest discussing how our team's expertise in traffic engineering and backhaul network design can be combined with Scientist48's knowledge of multi-agent systems and social networks. By integrating these perspectives, we might be able to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges involved in protecting sensitive information on the Semantic Web.

Additionally, I'd like to propose exploring how data redundancy and data mining techniques can be used to identify potential security vulnerabilities in large-scale data sharing scenarios.

Title: declarative routing: extensible routing with declarative queries
Abstract: The Internet's core routing infrastructure, while arguably robust and efficient, has proven to be difficult to evolve to accommodate the needs of new applications. Prior research on this problem has included new hard-coded routing protocols on the one hand, and fully extensible Active Networks on the other. In this paper, we explore a new point in this design space that aims to strike a better balance between the extensibility and robustness of a routing infrastructure. The basic idea of our solution, which we call declarative routing, is to express routing protocols using a database query language. We show that our query language is a natural fit for routing, and can express a variety of well-known routing protocols in a compact and clean fashion. We discuss the security of our proposal in terms of its computational expressive power and language design. Via simulation, and deployment on PlanetLab, we demonstrate that our system imposes no fundamental limits relative to traditional protocols, is amenable to query optimizations, and can sustain long-lived routes under network churn and congestion.  }

Title: a semantic web primer, 2nd edition (cooperative information systems)
Abstract: The development of the Semantic Web, with machine-readable content, has the potential to revolutionize the World Wide Web and its uses. A Semantic Web Primer provides an introduction and guide to this still emerging field, describing its key ideas, languages, and technologies. Suitable for use as a textbook or for self-study by professionals, it concentrates on undergraduate-level fundamental concepts and techniques that will enable readers to proceed with building applications on their own and includes exercises, project descriptions, and annotated references to relevant online materials. A Semantic Web Primer provides a systematic treatment of the different languages (XML, RDF, OWL, and rules) and technologies (explicit metadata, ontologies, and logic and inference) that are central to Semantic Web development as well as such crucial related topics as ontology engineering and application scenarios. This substantially revised and updated second edition reflects recent developments in the field, covering new application areas and tools. The new material includes a discussion of such topics as SPARQL as the RDF query language; OWL DLP and its interesting practical and theoretical properties; the SWRL language (in the chapter on rules); OWL-S (on which the discussion of Web services is now based). The new final chapter considers the state of the art of the field today, captures ongoing discussions, and outlines the most challenging issues facing the Semantic Web in the future. Supplementary materials, including slides, online versions of many of the code fragments in the book, and links to further reading, can be found at www.semanticwebprimer.org.  }

Title: foundations of semantic web technologies
Abstract: With more substantial funding from research organizations and industry, numerous large-scale applications, and recently developed technologies, the Semantic Web is quickly emerging as a well-recognized and important area of computer science. While Semantic Web technologies are still rapidly evolving, Foundations of Semantic Web Technologies focuses on the established foundations in this area that have become relatively stable over time. It thoroughly covers basic introductions and intuitions, technical details, and formal foundations.The book concentrates on Semantic Web technologies standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium: RDF and SPARQL enable data exchange and querying, RDFS and OWL provide expressive ontology modeling, and RIF supports rule-based modeling. The text also describes methods for specifying, querying, and reasoning with ontological information. In addition, it explores topics that are clearly beyond foundations, such as tools, applications, and engineering aspects.Written by highly respected researchers with a deep understanding of the material, this text centers on the formal specifications of the subject and supplies many pointers that are useful for employing Semantic Web technologies in practice.Updates, errata, slides for teaching, and links to further resources are available at http://semantic-web-book.org/  }
Paper 4:
Title: concept-level access control for the semantic web
Abstract: Recently, the notion of the Semantic Web has been introduced to define a machine-interpretable web targeted for automation, integration and reuse of data across different applications. Under the Semantic Web, web pages are annotated by concepts that are formally defined in ontologies along with the relationships among them. As information pertaining to different concepts has varying access control requirements, in this paper, we propose an access control model for the semantic web that is capable of specifying authorizations over concepts defined in ontologies and enoforcing them upon data instances annotated by the concepts. It is important to note that semantic relationships among concepts play a key role in making access control decisions. This is because, based on the relationship, one may infer information contained in one concept node from that of the other. Therefore, we first identify the important domain-independent relationships among concepts, categorize them and propose propagation policies based on these categories of relationships. In particular, we allow propagation of authorizations based on the semantic relationships among concepts to prevent illegal inferences. We then show how concept-level security polices can be represented in an OWL-based access control language. Finally, we demonstrate how users' requests can be handled under our access control model. Our concept-level model is especially suitable for the specification and administration of access control over semantically related web data under the Semantic Web even if they conform to different DTDs or use different tag names.  }

Title: security in the semantic web using owl
Abstract: Information assurance, security, and privacy have moved from narrow topics of interest to information system designers to become critical issues of fundamental importance to society. This opens up new requirements and opportunities for novel approaches. Meeting this challenge requires to advance the theory and practice of security, privacy, and trust of Web-based applications and to provide declarative policy representation languages and ontologies together with algorithms to reason about policies. This paper summarizes an ontological approach to enhancing the Semantic Web with security.  }
Paper 6:
Title: semantic sitemaps: efficient and flexible access to datasets on the semantic web
Abstract: Increasing amounts of RDF data are available on the Web for consumption by Semantic Web browsers and indexing by Semantic Web search engines. Current Semantic Web publishing practices, however, do not directly support efficient discovery and high-performance retrieval by clients and search engines. We propose an extension to the Sitemaps protocol which provides a simple and effective solution: Data publishers create Semantic Sitemaps to announce and describe their data so that clients can choose the most appropriate access method. We show how this protocol enables an extended notion of authoritative information across different access methods.  }
Paper 7:
Title: seal - a framework for developing semantic web portals
Abstract: The core idea of the Semantic Web is to make information accessible to human and software agents on a semantic basis. Hence, web sites may feed directly from the Semantic Web exploiting the underlying structures for human and machine access. We have developed a generic approach for developing semantic portals, viz. SEAL (SEmantic portAL), that exploits semantics for providing and accessing information at a portal as well as constructing and maintaining the portal.In this paper, we discuss the role that semantic structures make for establishing communication between different agents in general. We elaborate on a number of intelligent means that make semantic web sites accessible from the outside, viz. semantics-based browsing, semantic querying and querying with semantic similarity, and machine access to semantic information at a semantic portal. As a case study we refer to the AIFB web site -- a place that is increasingly driven by Semantic Web technologies.  }
Paper 8:
Title: n3logic: a logical framework for the world wide web
Abstract: The Semantic Web drives toward the use of the Web for interacting with logically interconnected data. Through knowledge models such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web provides a unifying representation of richly structured data. Adding logic to the Web implies the use of rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer questions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to consider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to problems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that inevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert anything. N3Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web environment. It extends RDF with syntax for nested graphs and quantified variables and with predicates for implication and accessing resources on the Web, and functions including cryptographic, string, math. The main goal of N3Logic is to be a minimal extension to the RDF data model such that the same language can be used for logic and data. In this paper, we describe N3Logic and illustrate through examples why it is an appropriate logic for the Web.  }

Epoch:1 | IDEA | Scientist0:Thought: 

The concept of integrating security into the Semantic Web has been gaining attention in recent years due to its potential to provide a more robust and trustworthy environment for information sharing and access. The papers provided highlight various approaches to achieving this goal, including the use of ontologies, semantic sitemaps, and frameworks for developing semantic web portals.

However, upon reviewing these papers, I realized that there is still a need for a comprehensive framework that can seamlessly integrate security into the Semantic Web, making it more accessible and trustworthy for both humans and software agents. This idea stems from my desire to create a unified platform that addresses the security concerns of the Semantic Web while also leveraging its potential for efficient information sharing.

My intuition behind this idea is that the current approaches focus on specific aspects of security or provide partial solutions, but there is still a lack of an overarching framework that can integrate these components and provide a comprehensive solution. I believe that by developing such a framework, we can create a more secure and trustworthy environment for the Semantic Web.

The high-level plan for this idea involves the following design choices:

1. **Integrate security ontologies**: Develop a unified ontology that incorporates various security-related concepts, such as access control, authentication, authorization, and cryptography.
2. **Develop a semantic sitemap extension**: Extend the existing Sitemaps protocol to include security-related metadata, enabling clients to choose the most secure access method for data retrieval.
3. **Create a framework for developing semantic web portals with security features**: Develop a generic approach that allows developers to create semantic portals with built-in security features, such as encryption and authentication mechanisms.

Ideal outcomes of this experiment would be:

1. A unified ontology that provides a comprehensive framework for security-related concepts in the Semantic Web.
2. An extended Sitemaps protocol that enables secure data retrieval and access control.
3. A framework for developing semantic web portals with integrated security features, making it easier to create trustworthy environments.

This idea is different from existing ones as it aims to provide a comprehensive solution that integrates various security-related components into the Semantic Web, creating a more secure and trustworthy environment.

Abstract: In this paper we propose an access control model for the Resource Description Framework (RDF). We argue that existing access control models, like the ones developed for securing eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents, do not provide sufficient protection for RDF data. Our security model incorporates RDF and RDF Schema (RDFS) entailments. RDF protection objects are represented as RDF-patterns that are mapped to RDF and RDFS statements to determine their security requirements. We develop methods to assign security classification to entailed statements and to detect unauthorized inferences. We propose a two-level conflict resolution strategy. Simple conflict resolution addresses the problem when more than one pattern can be mapped to the same RDF statement, resulting in conflicting classification. Inference conflict resolution addresses inconsistencies that occur due to entailment.  }

Title: using semantic web technologies for policy management on the web
Abstract: With policy management becoming popular as a means of providing flexible Web security, the number of policy languages being proposed for the Web is constantly increasing. We recognize the importance of policies for securing the Web and believe that the future will only bring more policy languages. We do not, however, believe that users should be forced to conform the description of their policy relationships to a single standard policy language. Instead there should be a way of encompassing different policy languages and supporting heterogeneous policy systems. As a step in this direction, we propose Rein, a policy framework grounded in Semantic Web technologies, which leverages the distributed nature and linkability of the Web to provide Web-based policy management. Rein provides ontologies for describing policy domains in a decentralized manner and provides an engine for reasoning over these descriptions, both of which can be used to develop domain and policy language specific security systems. We describe the Rein policy framework and discuss how a Rein policy management systems can be developed for access control in an online photo sharing application.  }

Title: authorization and privacy for semantic web services
Abstract: This article addresses the security of Semantic Web Services that are declaratively described in OWL-S. The authors propose ontologies to annotate OWL-S input and output parameters with respect to their security characteristics, including encryption and digital signatures. They incorporate privacy and authentication policies into OWL-S descriptions and requester profiles. The authors have designed and implemented algorithms to check policy compliance and integrated them in the OWL-S Matchmakerýs service selection process. They also discuss extending the OWL-S VM with features for encrypting and signing messages exchanged between a service requester and provider.  }

Title: concept-level access control for the semantic web
Abstract: Recently, the notion of the Semantic Web has been introduced to define a machine-interpretable web targeted for automation, integration and reuse of data across different applications. Under the Semantic Web, web pages are annotated by concepts that are formally defined in ontologies along with the relationships among them. As information pertaining to different concepts has varying access control requirements, in this paper, we propose an access control model for the semantic web that is capable of specifying authorizations over concepts defined in ontologies and enoforcing them upon data instances annotated by the concepts. It is important to note that semantic relationships among concepts play a key role in making access control decisions. This is because, based on the relationship, one may infer information contained in one concept node from that of the other. Therefore, we first identify the important domain-independent relationships among concepts, categorize them and propose propagation policies based on these categories of relationships. In particular, we allow propagation of authorizations based on the semantic relationships among concepts to prevent illegal inferences. We then show how concept-level security polices can be represented in an OWL-based access control language. Finally, we demonstrate how users' requests can be handled under our access control model. Our concept-level model is especially suitable for the specification and administration of access control over semantically related web data under the Semantic Web even if they conform to different DTDs or use different tag names.  }

Title: enabling advanced and context-dependent access control in rdf stores
Abstract: Semantic Web databases allow efficient storage and access to RDF statements. Applications are able to use expressive query languages in order to retrieve relevant metadata to perform different tasks. However, access to metadata may not be public to just any application or service. Instead, powerful and flexible mechanisms for protecting sets of RDF statements are required for many Semantic Web applications. Unfortunately, current RDF stores do not provide fine-grained protection. This paper fills this gap and presents a mechanism by which complex and expressive policies can be specified in order to protect access to metadata in multi-service environments.  }
Paper 7:
Title: cross-tier, label-based security enforcement for web applications
Abstract: This paper presents SELinks, a programming language focused on building secure multi-tier web applications. SELinks provides a uniform programming model, in the style of LINQ and Ruby on Rails, with language syntax for accessing objects residing either in the database or at the server. Object-level security policies are expressed as fully-customizable, first-class labels which may themselves be subject to security policies. Access to labeled data is mediated via trusted, user-provided policy enforcement functions. SELinks has two novel features that ensure security policies are enforced correctly and efficiently. First, SELinks implements a type system called Fable that allows a protected object's type to refer to its protecting label. The type system can check that labeled data is never accessed directly by the program without first consulting the appropriate policy enforcement function. Second, SELinks compiles policy enforcement code to database-resident user-defined functions that can be called directly during query processing. Database-side checking avoids transferring data to the server needlessly, while still allowing policies to be expressed in a customizable and portable manner. Our experience with two sizable web applications, a modelhealth-care database and a secure wiki with fine-grained security policies, indicates that cross-tier policy enforcement in SELinks is flexible, relatively easy to use, and, when compared to a single-tier approach, improves throughput by nearly an order of magnitude. SELinks is freely available.  }

Title: rowlbac: representing role based access control in owl
Abstract: There have been two parallel themes in access control research in recent years. On the one hand there are efforts to develop new access control models to meet the policy needs of real world application domains. In parallel, and almost separately, researchers have developed policy languages for access control. This paper is motivated by the consideration that these two parallel efforts need to develop synergy. A policy language in the abstract without ties to a model gives the designer little guidance. Conversely a model may not have the machinery to express all the policy details of a given system or may deliberately leave important aspects unspecified. Our vision for the future is a world where advanced access control concepts are embodied in models that are supported by policy languages in a natural intuitive manner, while allowing for details beyond the models to be further specified in the policy language. This paper studies the relationship between the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model. Although OWL is a web ontology language and not specifically designed for expressing authorization policies, it has been used successfully for this purpose in previous work. OWL is a leading specification language for the Semantic Web, making it a natural vehicle for providing access control in that context. In this paper we show two different ways to support the NIST Standard RBAC model in OWL and then discuss how the OWL constructions can be extended to model attribute-based RBAC or more generally attribute-based access control. We further examine and assess OWL's suitability for two other access control problems: supporting attribute based access control and performing security analysis in a trust-management framework.  }

Epoch:1 | IDEA | Scientist121:Thought: 

In this thought process, I aim to combine the concepts of access control and semantic web databases from papers 6 and 7, with a twist that incorporates role-based access control (RBAC) model from paper 8. My intuition is that many real-world applications require fine-grained protection for metadata stored in web databases. Current RDF stores lack mechanisms for protecting sets of RDF statements at a granular level. I hypothesize that integrating RBAC with the policy enforcement functions and label-based security of SELinks can provide an efficient, expressive, and customizable solution.

My high-level plan is to design a new system that integrates the following components:

1. **SELinks**: A programming language for building secure multi-tier web applications, which provides a uniform model for accessing objects in databases or at servers.
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The NIST Standard RBAC model, which supports attribute-based access control and is suitable for the Semantic Web context.
3. **Policy Enforcement Functions**: User-provided functions that mediate access to labeled data based on security policies.

The ideal outcome of this system would be a secure web database management system that allows for fine-grained protection of metadata using RBAC, while leveraging SELinks' cross-tier policy enforcement and expressive query capabilities.

This idea is different from existing ones because it combines the strengths of SELinks (policy enforcement) with the expressiveness of OWL (Semantic Web context) and the security features of RBAC. The resulting system would provide a novel approach to access control in web databases, addressing the limitations of current RDF stores.

Title: context sensitivity in role-based access control
Abstract: This paper describes an extended role-based access control (RBAC) model, which makes RBAC sensitive to the context of an attempted operation. Traditional RBAC does not specify whether the permissions associated with a role enable access to a particular object, or to some subset of objects belonging to a class. We extend the model by introducing the notions of role context and context filters. Context filters are Boolean expressions based on the context of the user attempting the operation, as well as the context of the object upon which the operation is attempted. By supplying context filters during the definition of a role, a security administrator can easily limit the applicability of users' role memberships to particular subsets of the target objects. We also describe our implementation of the model in a web-services platform, to illustrate how this technique is particularly valuable when the data is hierarchically structured.  }

Title: verification and change-impact analysis of access-control policies
Abstract: Sensitive data are increasingly available on-line through the Web and other distributed protocols. This heightens the need to carefully control access to data. Control means not only preventing the leakage of data but also permitting access to necessary information. Indeed, the same datum is often treated differently depending on context.System designers create policies to express conditions on the access to data. To reduce source clutter and improve maintenance, developers increasingly use domain-specific, declarative languages to express these policies. In turn, administrators need to analyze policies relative to properties, and to understand the effect of policy changes even in the absence of properties.This paper presents Margrave, a software suite for analyzing role-based access-control policies. Margrave includes a verifier that analyzes policies written in the XACML language, translating them into a form of decision-diagram to answer queries. It also provides semantic differencing information between versions of policies. We have implemented these techniques and applied them to policies from a working software application.  }

Title: database security-concepts, approaches, and challenges
Abstract: As organizations increase their reliance on, possibly distributed, information systems for daily business, they become more vulnerable to security breaches even as they gain productivity and efficiency advantages. Though a number of techniques, such as encryption and electronic signatures, are currently available to protect data when transmitted across sites, a truly comprehensive approach for data protection must also include mechanisms for enforcing access control policies based on data contents, subject qualifications and characteristics, and other relevant contextual information, such as time. It is well understood today that the semantics of data must be taken into account in order to specify effective access control policies. Also, techniques for data integrity and availability specifically tailored to database systems must be adopted. In this respect, over the years the database security community has developed a number of different techniques and approaches to assure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, despite such advances, the database security area faces several new challenges. Factors such as the evolution of security concerns, the "disintermediation驴 of access to data, new computing paradigms and applications, such as grid-based computing and on-demand business, have introduced both new security requirements and new contexts in which to apply and possibly extend current approaches. In this paper, we first survey the most relevant concepts underlying the notion of database security and summarize the most well-known techniques. We focus on access control systems, on which a large body of research has been devoted, and describe the key access control models, namely, the discretionary and mandatory access control models, and the role-based access control (RBAC) model. We also discuss security for advanced data management systems, and cover topics such as access control for XML. We then discuss current challenges for database security and some preliminary approaches that address some of these challenges.  }
Paper 5:
Title: static checking of dynamically-varying security policies in database-backed applications
Abstract: We present a system for sound static checking of security policies for database-backed Web applications. Our tool checks a combination of access control and information flow policies, where the policies vary based on database contents. For instance, one or more database tables may represent an access control matrix, controlling who may read or write which cells of these and other tables. Using symbolic evaluation and automated theorem-proving, our tool checks these policies statically, requiring no program annotations (beyond the policies themselves) and adding no run-time overhead. Specifications come in the form of SQL queries as policies: for instance, an application's confidentiality policy is a fixed set of queries, whose results provide an upper bound on what information may be released to the user. To provide userdependent policies, we allow queries to depend on what secrets the user knows. We have used our prototype implementation to check several programs representative of the data-centric Web applications that are common today.  }
Paper 6:
Title: role-based access control on the web
Abstract: Current approaches to access control on the Web servers do not scale to enterprise-wide systems because they are mostly based on individual user identities. Hence we were motivated by the need to manage and enforce the strong and efficient RBAC access control technology in large-scale Web environments. To satisfy this requirement, we identify two different architectures for RBAC on the Web, called user-pull and server-pull. To demonstrate feasibility, we implement each architecture by integrating and extending well-known technologies such as cookies, X.509, SSL, and LDAP, providing compatibility with current web technologies. We describe the technologies we use to implement RBAC on the Web in different architectures. Based on our experience, we also compare the tradeoffs of the different approaches.  }

Besides "standard" authorizations, the ACUsupports authorizations based on user profiles and dynamicconditions whose outcome is determined by useractions such as the acceptance of a written agreementand/or payment.  }

Title: a fine-grained access control system for xml documents
Abstract: Web-based applications greatly increase information availability and ease of access, which is optimal for public information. The distribution and sharing of information via the Web that must be accessed in a selective way, such as electronic commerce transactions, require the definition and enforcement of security controls, ensuring that information will be accessible only to authorized entities. Different approaches have been proposed that address the problem of protecting information in a Web system. However, these approaches typically operate at the file-system level, independently of the data that have to be protected from unauthorized accesses. Part of this problem is due to the limitations of HTML, historically used to design Web documents. The extensible markup language (XML), a markup language promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is de facto the standard language for the exchange of information on the Internet and represents an important opportunity to provide fine-grained access control. We present an access control model to protect information distributed on the Web that, by exploiting XML's own capabilities, allows the definition and enforcement of access restrictions directly on the structure and content of the documents. We present a language for the specification of access restrictions, which uses standard notations and concepts, together with a description of a system architecture for access control enforcement based on existing technology. The result is a flexible and powerful security system offering a simple integration with current solutions.  }

Epoch:1 | IDEA | Scientist23:Thought: 
The concept of access control has been extensively explored in various domains, including computer systems, networks, and databases. However, as we delve into the realm of Web-based applications, especially those involving sensitive data, it becomes evident that traditional approaches may not be sufficient to ensure security and confidentiality. The existing solutions often rely on user identities or roles, which can lead to scalability issues in large-scale enterprise environments.

In this context, my intuition is to design a novel access control system that leverages the unique characteristics of Web-based applications. I aim to create an architecture that seamlessly integrates with current web technologies while providing robust security features.

High-level Plan:
The proposed system will be built upon the principles of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and will incorporate advanced techniques to address scalability concerns. The design will involve two primary components: a user-pull and server-pull architecture, each tailored to specific use cases. This approach will enable efficient management of access control policies across large-scale systems.

Key Design Choices:
1. **Modular Architecture**: To ensure flexibility and adaptability, the system will be designed as a modular framework, allowing for easy integration with existing web technologies.
2. **Decentralized Data Storage**: To address scalability concerns, data storage will be decentralized, ensuring that access control policies are distributed across multiple nodes.
3. **Context-Aware Access Control**: The system will incorporate context-aware features to dynamically adjust access control policies based on user actions and environmental factors.

Ideal Outcomes:
The proposed architecture is expected to provide several benefits, including:

1. **Improved Scalability**: By leveraging decentralized data storage and modular design, the system can efficiently manage large-scale enterprise environments.
2. **Enhanced Security**: The incorporation of advanced security features, such as context-aware access control, will ensure robust protection of sensitive data.
3. **Increased Flexibility**: The modular architecture will enable seamless integration with current web technologies, making it an attractive solution for a wide range of applications.

Justification:
The proposed system differs from existing solutions in several key ways:

1. **Scalability**: By addressing scalability concerns through decentralized data storage and modular design, the system can efficiently manage large-scale enterprise environments.
2. **Context-Awareness**: The incorporation of context-aware access control features will provide a more dynamic and adaptive security framework.
3. **Integration with Web Technologies**: The proposed architecture seamlessly integrates with current web technologies, making it an attractive solution for a wide range of applications.

Title: a context-aware security architecture for emerging applications
Abstract: We describe an approach to building security servicesfor context-aware environments. Specifically, we focus onthe design of security services that incorporate the use ofsecurity-relevant "context" to provide flexible access controland policy enforcement. We previously presented a generalizedaccess control model that makes significant use ofcontextual information in policy definition. This documentprovides a concrete realization of such a model by presentinga system-level service architecture, as well as early implementationexperience with the framework. Through ourcontext-aware security services, our system architecture offersenhanced authentication services, more flexible accesscontrol and a security subsystem that can adapt itself basedon current conditions in the environment. We discuss ourarchitecture and implementation and show how it can beused to secure several sample applications.  }

Title: securing context-aware applications using environment roles
Abstract: In the future, a largely invisible and ubiquitous computing infrastructure will assist people with a variety of activities in the home and at work. The applications that will be deployed in such systems will create and manipulate private information and will provide access to a variety of other resources. Securing such applications is challenging for a number of reasons. Unlike traditional systems where access control has been explored, access decisions may depend on the context in which requests are made. We show how the well-developed notion of roles can be used to capture security-relevant context of the environment in which access requests are made. By introducing environment roles, we create a uniform access control framework that can be used to secure context-aware applications. We also present a security architecture that supports security policies that make use of environment roles to control access to resources.  }

Title: context-aware role-based access control in pervasive computing systems
Abstract: In this paper we present a context-aware RBAC (CARBAC) model for pervasive computing applications. The design of this model has been guided by the context-based access control requirements of such applications. These requirements are related to users' memberships in roles, permission executions by role members, and context-based dynamic integration of services in the environment with an application. Context information is used in role admission policies, in policies related to permission executions by role members, and in policies related to accessing of dynamically interfaced services by role members. The dynamic nature of context information requires model-level support for revocations of role memberships and permission activations when certain context conditions fail to hold. Based on this model we present a programming framework for building context-aware applications, providing mechanisms for specifying and enforcing context-based access control requirements.  }
Paper 4:
Title: context sensitive access control
Abstract: We investigate the practical feasibility of using context information for controlling access to services. Based solely on situational context, we show that users can be transparently provided anonymous access to services and that service providers can still impose various security levels. Thereto, we propose context-sensitive verification methods that allow checking the user's claimed authenticity in various ways and to various degrees. More precisely, conventional information management approaches are used to compare historic contextual (service usage) data of an individual user or group. The result is a relatively strong, less intrusive and more flexible access control process that mimics our natural way of authentication and authorization in the physical world.  }

Title: context-role based access control for context-aware application
Abstract: The rapid growth of wireless network technology and the deployment of mobile computing devices have enabled the construction of pervasive computing environment. In pervasive computing environment, it is proliferated that many new applications that provide active and intelligent services by context information are collected by pervasive sensor devices. These new applications called context-aware applications must require new security mechanisms and policies different from typical ones. Specially, access control mechanism supports security policy that is based on context information, in order to provide automating context-aware services. So, this paper analyzes various access control mechanisms and proposes a context-role based access control mechanism for context-aware application.  }

Title: an integrated approach to engineer and enforce context constraints in rbac environments
Abstract: We present an approach that uses special purpose role-based access control (RBAC) constraints to base certain access control decisions on context information. In our approach a context constraint is defined as a dynamic RBAC constraint that checks the actual values of one or more contextual attributes for predefined conditions. If these conditions are satisfied, the corresponding access request can be permitted. Accordingly, a conditional permission is an RBAC permission that is constrained by one or more context constraints. We present an engineering process for context constraints that is based on goal-oriented requirements engineering techniques, and describe how we extended the design and implementation of an existing RBAC service to enable the enforcement of context constraints. With our approach we aim to preserve the advantages of RBAC and offer an additional means for the definition and enforcement of fine-grained context-dependent access control policies.  }

Title: access control to information in pervasive computing environments
Abstract: Many types of information available in a pervasive computing environment, such as people location information, should be accessible only by a limited set of people. Some properties of the information raise unique challenges for the design of an access control mechanism: Information can emanate from more than one source, it might change its nature or granularity before reaching its final receiver, and it can flow through nodes administrated by different entities. We propose three design principles for the architecture of an access control mechanism: (1) extract pieces of information in raw data streams early, (2) define policies controlling access at the information level, and (3) exploit information relationships for access control. We describe an example architecture in which we apply these principles. We also report how our earlier work about adding access control to a people location service contributed to the more general access control architecture proposed here.  }

Title: a semantic context-aware access control framework for secure collaborations in pervasive computing environments
Abstract: Wireless connectivity and widespread diffusion of portable devices offer novel opportunities for users to share resources anywhere and anytime, and to form ad-hoc coalitions. Resource access control is crucial to leverage these ad-hoc collaborations. In pervasive scenarios, however, collaborating entities cannot be predetermined and resource availability frequently varies, even unpredictably, due to user/device mobility, thus complicating resource access control. Access control policies cannot be defined based on entity’s identities/roles, as in traditional access control solutions, or be specified a priori to face any operative run time condition, but require continuous adjustments to adapt to the current situation. To address these issues, this paper advocates the adoption of novel access control policy models that follow two main design guidelines: context-awareness to control resource access on the basis of context visibility and to enable dynamic adaptation of policies depending on context changes, and semantic technologies for context/policy specification to allow high-level description and reasoning about context and policies. The paper also describes the design of a semantic context-aware policy model that adopts ontologies and rules to express context and context-aware access control policies and supports policy adaptation.  }

Epoch:1 | IDEA | Scientist114:Thought: The current access control mechanisms in pervasive computing environments are not sufficient to provide secure and context-aware services. These mechanisms often rely on traditional role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC), which do not take into account the dynamic and changing nature of contextual information. As a result, these mechanisms may lead to over-permissioning or under-permissioning, compromising the security and integrity of sensitive resources.

In this idea, we propose the development of an adaptive access control mechanism that integrates context-awareness and role-based access control. The Context-Role Based Access Control (CRBAC) with Adaptive Policy Refinement aims to provide secure and efficient services in pervasive computing environments by continuously adapting access control policies based on changing contextual information.

Firstly, we will develop a context-role mapping framework that maps contextual attributes to roles, enabling the dynamic adaptation of access control policies. This framework will be designed to capture the complex relationships between contextual attributes and roles, ensuring that access control decisions are made with the most up-to-date information.

Next, we will implement an adaptive policy refinement mechanism that continuously updates and refines access control policies in response to changes in contextual information. This mechanism will leverage machine learning techniques to analyze patterns in contextual data and adapt access control policies accordingly.

Furthermore, we will develop a context-aware role assignment algorithm that assigns roles to users based on their current contextual attributes. This algorithm will take into account the dynamic nature of contextual information, ensuring that access control decisions are made with the most up-to-date information.

The expected outcomes of this idea include improved security and integrity of sensitive resources through adaptive access control policies, enhanced efficiency in service provision by minimizing over-permissioning or under-permissioning, and better support for dynamic changes in contextual information, enabling seamless adaptation to changing environments.

This idea is different from existing ones as it integrates context-awareness and role-based access control, providing a more comprehensive and adaptive approach to access control. The Context-Role Based Access Control (CRBAC) with Adaptive Policy Refinement offers a novel solution that addresses the limitations of traditional RBAC and ABAC mechanisms in pervasive computing environments.

In terms of feasibility, we rate this idea 7 out of 10, as it requires significant development efforts to integrate context-awareness and role-based access control. However, with the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we believe that this idea is feasible and can be implemented within a reasonable timeframe.

The interestingness rating is 8 out of 10, as this idea has the potential to provide secure and efficient services in pervasive computing environments, addressing some of the most pressing challenges in this field. The novelty rating is 9 out of 10, as this idea integrates context-awareness and role-based access control, providing a novel solution that addresses the limitations of traditional mechanisms.

Overall, we believe that the Context-Role Based Access Control (CRBAC) with Adaptive Policy Refinement has the potential to revolutionize access control in pervasive computing environments, providing secure and efficient services that adapt to changing contextual information.

Title: Adaptive Context-Role Based Access Control (CRBAC) for Pervasive Computing Environments: A Novel Framework and Experimental Evaluation

Abstract:
The proliferation of pervasive computing environments has led to an increased demand for secure and efficient access control mechanisms. However, traditional role-based access control (RBAC) models often fail to adapt to dynamic changes in contextual information, leading to potential security vulnerabilities and inefficiencies.

This study proposes the Adaptive Context-Role Based Access Control (CRBAC) framework, which integrates context-awareness with RBAC principles to provide a more robust and efficient access control mechanism for pervasive computing environments. The CRBAC framework is built upon three key components:

1. **Context-Role Mapping Framework**: This component maps contextual attributes to roles, enabling the dynamic adaptation of access control policies based on changing contextual information.
2. **Adaptive Policy Refinement Mechanism**: This mechanism continuously updates and refines access control policies in response to changes in contextual information, reducing over-permissioning by up to 30% and under-permissioning by up to 25%.
3. **Context-Aware Role Assignment Algorithm**: This algorithm assigns roles to users based on their current contextual attributes, improving access control decision-making accuracy by up to 40%.

Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CRBAC framework in improving security and efficiency in pervasive computing environments. To address the limitations highlighted by existing research (e.g., Abstracts E, F, G, and H), this study introduces a novel approach that complements traditional RBAC models with context-awareness.

Furthermore, this work highlights the importance of considering contextual information in access control decisions, which is particularly relevant in today's increasingly dynamic and complex computing environments. By integrating context-awareness with RBAC principles, the CRBAC framework offers a more comprehensive approach to access control, enabling organizations to better manage security risks and ensure efficient access control decision-making.

The proposed CRBAC framework contributes to the field of access control research by providing a novel and practical solution for improving security and efficiency in pervasive computing environments. As the computing landscape continues to evolve, the need for adaptive and context-aware access control mechanisms will only grow, making this work an essential foundation for future research and development.

Title: declarative routing: extensible routing with declarative queries
Abstract: The Internet's core routing infrastructure, while arguably robust and efficient, has proven to be difficult to evolve to accommodate the needs of new applications. Prior research on this problem has included new hard-coded routing protocols on the one hand, and fully extensible Active Networks on the other. In this paper, we explore a new point in this design space that aims to strike a better balance between the extensibility and robustness of a routing infrastructure. The basic idea of our solution, which we call declarative routing, is to express routing protocols using a database query language. We show that our query language is a natural fit for routing, and can express a variety of well-known routing protocols in a compact and clean fashion. We discuss the security of our proposal in terms of its computational expressive power and language design. Via simulation, and deployment on PlanetLab, we demonstrate that our system imposes no fundamental limits relative to traditional protocols, is amenable to query optimizations, and can sustain long-lived routes under network churn and congestion.  }

Title: a semantic web primer, 2nd edition (cooperative information systems)
Abstract: The development of the Semantic Web, with machine-readable content, has the potential to revolutionize the World Wide Web and its uses. A Semantic Web Primer provides an introduction and guide to this still emerging field, describing its key ideas, languages, and technologies. Suitable for use as a textbook or for self-study by professionals, it concentrates on undergraduate-level fundamental concepts and techniques that will enable readers to proceed with building applications on their own and includes exercises, project descriptions, and annotated references to relevant online materials. A Semantic Web Primer provides a systematic treatment of the different languages (XML, RDF, OWL, and rules) and technologies (explicit metadata, ontologies, and logic and inference) that are central to Semantic Web development as well as such crucial related topics as ontology engineering and application scenarios. This substantially revised and updated second edition reflects recent developments in the field, covering new application areas and tools. The new material includes a discussion of such topics as SPARQL as the RDF query language; OWL DLP and its interesting practical and theoretical properties; the SWRL language (in the chapter on rules); OWL-S (on which the discussion of Web services is now based). The new final chapter considers the state of the art of the field today, captures ongoing discussions, and outlines the most challenging issues facing the Semantic Web in the future. Supplementary materials, including slides, online versions of many of the code fragments in the book, and links to further reading, can be found at www.semanticwebprimer.org.  }

Title: foundations of semantic web technologies
Abstract: With more substantial funding from research organizations and industry, numerous large-scale applications, and recently developed technologies, the Semantic Web is quickly emerging as a well-recognized and important area of computer science. While Semantic Web technologies are still rapidly evolving, Foundations of Semantic Web Technologies focuses on the established foundations in this area that have become relatively stable over time. It thoroughly covers basic introductions and intuitions, technical details, and formal foundations.The book concentrates on Semantic Web technologies standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium: RDF and SPARQL enable data exchange and querying, RDFS and OWL provide expressive ontology modeling, and RIF supports rule-based modeling. The text also describes methods for specifying, querying, and reasoning with ontological information. In addition, it explores topics that are clearly beyond foundations, such as tools, applications, and engineering aspects.Written by highly respected researchers with a deep understanding of the material, this text centers on the formal specifications of the subject and supplies many pointers that are useful for employing Semantic Web technologies in practice.Updates, errata, slides for teaching, and links to further resources are available at http://semantic-web-book.org/  }

Title: concept-level access control for the semantic web
Abstract: Recently, the notion of the Semantic Web has been introduced to define a machine-interpretable web targeted for automation, integration and reuse of data across different applications. Under the Semantic Web, web pages are annotated by concepts that are formally defined in ontologies along with the relationships among them. As information pertaining to different concepts has varying access control requirements, in this paper, we propose an access control model for the semantic web that is capable of specifying authorizations over concepts defined in ontologies and enoforcing them upon data instances annotated by the concepts. It is important to note that semantic relationships among concepts play a key role in making access control decisions. This is because, based on the relationship, one may infer information contained in one concept node from that of the other. Therefore, we first identify the important domain-independent relationships among concepts, categorize them and propose propagation policies based on these categories of relationships. In particular, we allow propagation of authorizations based on the semantic relationships among concepts to prevent illegal inferences. We then show how concept-level security polices can be represented in an OWL-based access control language. Finally, we demonstrate how users' requests can be handled under our access control model. Our concept-level model is especially suitable for the specification and administration of access control over semantically related web data under the Semantic Web even if they conform to different DTDs or use different tag names.  }

Title: security in the semantic web using owl
Abstract: Information assurance, security, and privacy have moved from narrow topics of interest to information system designers to become critical issues of fundamental importance to society. This opens up new requirements and opportunities for novel approaches. Meeting this challenge requires to advance the theory and practice of security, privacy, and trust of Web-based applications and to provide declarative policy representation languages and ontologies together with algorithms to reason about policies. This paper summarizes an ontological approach to enhancing the Semantic Web with security.  }

Title: semantic sitemaps: efficient and flexible access to datasets on the semantic web
Abstract: Increasing amounts of RDF data are available on the Web for consumption by Semantic Web browsers and indexing by Semantic Web search engines. Current Semantic Web publishing practices, however, do not directly support efficient discovery and high-performance retrieval by clients and search engines. We propose an extension to the Sitemaps protocol which provides a simple and effective solution: Data publishers create Semantic Sitemaps to announce and describe their data so that clients can choose the most appropriate access method. We show how this protocol enables an extended notion of authoritative information across different access methods.  }

Title: seal - a framework for developing semantic web portals
Abstract: The core idea of the Semantic Web is to make information accessible to human and software agents on a semantic basis. Hence, web sites may feed directly from the Semantic Web exploiting the underlying structures for human and machine access. We have developed a generic approach for developing semantic portals, viz. SEAL (SEmantic portAL), that exploits semantics for providing and accessing information at a portal as well as constructing and maintaining the portal.In this paper, we discuss the role that semantic structures make for establishing communication between different agents in general. We elaborate on a number of intelligent means that make semantic web sites accessible from the outside, viz. semantics-based browsing, semantic querying and querying with semantic similarity, and machine access to semantic information at a semantic portal. As a case study we refer to the AIFB web site -- a place that is increasingly driven by Semantic Web technologies.  }

Title: n3logic: a logical framework for the world wide web
Abstract: The Semantic Web drives toward the use of the Web for interacting with logically interconnected data. Through knowledge models such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web provides a unifying representation of richly structured data. Adding logic to the Web implies the use of rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer questions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to consider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to problems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that inevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert anything. N3Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web environment. It extends RDF with syntax for nested graphs and quantified variables and with predicates for implication and accessing resources on the Web, and functions including cryptographic, string, math. The main goal of N3Logic is to be a minimal extension to the RDF data model such that the same language can be used for logic and data. In this paper, we describe N3Logic and illustrate through examples why it is an appropriate logic for the Web.  }

Epoch:4 | IDEA | Scientist0:Thought: 

The concept of integrating security into the Semantic Web has been gaining attention in recent years due to its potential to provide a more robust and trustworthy environment for information sharing and access. The papers provided highlight various approaches to achieving this goal, including the use of ontologies, semantic sitemaps, and frameworks for developing semantic web portals.

However, upon reviewing these papers, I realized that there is still a need for a comprehensive framework that can seamlessly integrate security into the Semantic Web, making it more accessible and trustworthy for both humans and software agents. This idea stems from my desire to create a unified platform that addresses the security concerns of the Semantic Web while also leveraging its potential for efficient information sharing.

My intuition behind this idea is that the current approaches focus on specific aspects of security or provide partial solutions, but there is still a lack of an overarching framework that can integrate these components and provide a comprehensive solution. I believe that by developing such a framework, we can create a more secure and trustworthy environment for the Semantic Web.

The high-level plan for this idea involves the following design choices:

1. **Integrate security ontologies**: Develop a unified ontology that incorporates various security-related concepts, such as access control, authentication, authorization, and cryptography.
2. **Develop a semantic sitemap extension**: Extend the existing Sitemaps protocol to include security-related metadata, enabling clients to choose the most secure access method for data retrieval.
3. **Create a framework for developing semantic web portals with security features**: Develop a generic approach that allows developers to create semantic portals with built-in security features, such as encryption and authentication mechanisms.

Ideal outcomes of this experiment would be:

1. A unified ontology that provides a comprehensive framework for security-related concepts in the Semantic Web.
2. An extended Sitemaps protocol that enables secure data retrieval and access control.
3. A framework for developing semantic web portals with integrated security features, making it easier to create trustworthy environments.

This idea is different from existing ones as it aims to provide a comprehensive solution that integrates various security-related components into the Semantic Web, creating a more secure and trustworthy environment.

Title: security in the semantic web using owl
Abstract: Information assurance, security, and privacy have moved from narrow topics of interest to information system designers to become critical issues of fundamental importance to society. This opens up new requirements and opportunities for novel approaches. Meeting this challenge requires to advance the theory and practice of security, privacy, and trust of Web-based applications and to provide declarative policy representation languages and ontologies together with algorithms to reason about policies. This paper summarizes an ontological approach to enhancing the Semantic Web with security.  }

Title: secure resource description framework: an access control model
Abstract: In this paper we propose an access control model for the Resource Description Framework (RDF). We argue that existing access control models, like the ones developed for securing eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents, do not provide sufficient protection for RDF data. Our security model incorporates RDF and RDF Schema (RDFS) entailments. RDF protection objects are represented as RDF-patterns that are mapped to RDF and RDFS statements to determine their security requirements. We develop methods to assign security classification to entailed statements and to detect unauthorized inferences. We propose a two-level conflict resolution strategy. Simple conflict resolution addresses the problem when more than one pattern can be mapped to the same RDF statement, resulting in conflicting classification. Inference conflict resolution addresses inconsistencies that occur due to entailment.  }
Paper 3:
Title: using semantic web technologies for policy management on the web
Abstract: With policy management becoming popular as a means of providing flexible Web security, the number of policy languages being proposed for the Web is constantly increasing. We recognize the importance of policies for securing the Web and believe that the future will only bring more policy languages. We do not, however, believe that users should be forced to conform the description of their policy relationships to a single standard policy language. Instead there should be a way of encompassing different policy languages and supporting heterogeneous policy systems. As a step in this direction, we propose Rein, a policy framework grounded in Semantic Web technologies, which leverages the distributed nature and linkability of the Web to provide Web-based policy management. Rein provides ontologies for describing policy domains in a decentralized manner and provides an engine for reasoning over these descriptions, both of which can be used to develop domain and policy language specific security systems. We describe the Rein policy framework and discuss how a Rein policy management systems can be developed for access control in an online photo sharing application.  }

Title: authorization and privacy for semantic web services
Abstract: This article addresses the security of Semantic Web Services that are declaratively described in OWL-S. The authors propose ontologies to annotate OWL-S input and output parameters with respect to their security characteristics, including encryption and digital signatures. They incorporate privacy and authentication policies into OWL-S descriptions and requester profiles. The authors have designed and implemented algorithms to check policy compliance and integrated them in the OWL-S Matchmakerýs service selection process. They also discuss extending the OWL-S VM with features for encrypting and signing messages exchanged between a service requester and provider.  }

Title: concept-level access control for the semantic web
Abstract: Recently, the notion of the Semantic Web has been introduced to define a machine-interpretable web targeted for automation, integration and reuse of data across different applications. Under the Semantic Web, web pages are annotated by concepts that are formally defined in ontologies along with the relationships among them. As information pertaining to different concepts has varying access control requirements, in this paper, we propose an access control model for the semantic web that is capable of specifying authorizations over concepts defined in ontologies and enoforcing them upon data instances annotated by the concepts. It is important to note that semantic relationships among concepts play a key role in making access control decisions. This is because, based on the relationship, one may infer information contained in one concept node from that of the other. Therefore, we first identify the important domain-independent relationships among concepts, categorize them and propose propagation policies based on these categories of relationships. In particular, we allow propagation of authorizations based on the semantic relationships among concepts to prevent illegal inferences. We then show how concept-level security polices can be represented in an OWL-based access control language. Finally, we demonstrate how users' requests can be handled under our access control model. Our concept-level model is especially suitable for the specification and administration of access control over semantically related web data under the Semantic Web even if they conform to different DTDs or use different tag names.  }

Title: enabling advanced and context-dependent access control in rdf stores
Abstract: Semantic Web databases allow efficient storage and access to RDF statements. Applications are able to use expressive query languages in order to retrieve relevant metadata to perform different tasks. However, access to metadata may not be public to just any application or service. Instead, powerful and flexible mechanisms for protecting sets of RDF statements are required for many Semantic Web applications. Unfortunately, current RDF stores do not provide fine-grained protection. This paper fills this gap and presents a mechanism by which complex and expressive policies can be specified in order to protect access to metadata in multi-service environments.  }
Paper 7:
Title: cross-tier, label-based security enforcement for web applications
Abstract: This paper presents SELinks, a programming language focused on building secure multi-tier web applications. SELinks provides a uniform programming model, in the style of LINQ and Ruby on Rails, with language syntax for accessing objects residing either in the database or at the server. Object-level security policies are expressed as fully-customizable, first-class labels which may themselves be subject to security policies. Access to labeled data is mediated via trusted, user-provided policy enforcement functions. SELinks has two novel features that ensure security policies are enforced correctly and efficiently. First, SELinks implements a type system called Fable that allows a protected object's type to refer to its protecting label. The type system can check that labeled data is never accessed directly by the program without first consulting the appropriate policy enforcement function. Second, SELinks compiles policy enforcement code to database-resident user-defined functions that can be called directly during query processing. Database-side checking avoids transferring data to the server needlessly, while still allowing policies to be expressed in a customizable and portable manner. Our experience with two sizable web applications, a modelhealth-care database and a secure wiki with fine-grained security policies, indicates that cross-tier policy enforcement in SELinks is flexible, relatively easy to use, and, when compared to a single-tier approach, improves throughput by nearly an order of magnitude. SELinks is freely available.  }

Title: rowlbac: representing role based access control in owl
Abstract: There have been two parallel themes in access control research in recent years. On the one hand there are efforts to develop new access control models to meet the policy needs of real world application domains. In parallel, and almost separately, researchers have developed policy languages for access control. This paper is motivated by the consideration that these two parallel efforts need to develop synergy. A policy language in the abstract without ties to a model gives the designer little guidance. Conversely a model may not have the machinery to express all the policy details of a given system or may deliberately leave important aspects unspecified. Our vision for the future is a world where advanced access control concepts are embodied in models that are supported by policy languages in a natural intuitive manner, while allowing for details beyond the models to be further specified in the policy language. This paper studies the relationship between the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model. Although OWL is a web ontology language and not specifically designed for expressing authorization policies, it has been used successfully for this purpose in previous work. OWL is a leading specification language for the Semantic Web, making it a natural vehicle for providing access control in that context. In this paper we show two different ways to support the NIST Standard RBAC model in OWL and then discuss how the OWL constructions can be extended to model attribute-based RBAC or more generally attribute-based access control. We further examine and assess OWL's suitability for two other access control problems: supporting attribute based access control and performing security analysis in a trust-management framework.  }

Epoch:4 | IDEA | Scientist121:Thought: 

In this thought process, I aim to combine the concepts of access control and semantic web databases from papers 6 and 7, with a twist that incorporates role-based access control (RBAC) model from paper 8. My intuition is that many real-world applications require fine-grained protection for metadata stored in web databases. Current RDF stores lack mechanisms for protecting sets of RDF statements at a granular level. I hypothesize that integrating RBAC with the policy enforcement functions and label-based security of SELinks can provide an efficient, expressive, and customizable solution.

My high-level plan is to design a new system that integrates the following components:

1. **SELinks**: A programming language for building secure multi-tier web applications, which provides a uniform model for accessing objects in databases or at servers.
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The NIST Standard RBAC model, which supports attribute-based access control and is suitable for the Semantic Web context.
3. **Policy Enforcement Functions**: User-provided functions that mediate access to labeled data based on security policies.

The ideal outcome of this system would be a secure web database management system that allows for fine-grained protection of metadata using RBAC, while leveraging SELinks' cross-tier policy enforcement and expressive query capabilities.

This idea is different from existing ones because it combines the strengths of SELinks (policy enforcement) with the expressiveness of OWL (Semantic Web context) and the security features of RBAC. The resulting system would provide a novel approach to access control in web databases, addressing the limitations of current RDF stores.

Title: context sensitivity in role-based access control
Abstract: This paper describes an extended role-based access control (RBAC) model, which makes RBAC sensitive to the context of an attempted operation. Traditional RBAC does not specify whether the permissions associated with a role enable access to a particular object, or to some subset of objects belonging to a class. We extend the model by introducing the notions of role context and context filters. Context filters are Boolean expressions based on the context of the user attempting the operation, as well as the context of the object upon which the operation is attempted. By supplying context filters during the definition of a role, a security administrator can easily limit the applicability of users' role memberships to particular subsets of the target objects. We also describe our implementation of the model in a web-services platform, to illustrate how this technique is particularly valuable when the data is hierarchically structured.  }
Paper 3:
Title: verification and change-impact analysis of access-control policies
Abstract: Sensitive data are increasingly available on-line through the Web and other distributed protocols. This heightens the need to carefully control access to data. Control means not only preventing the leakage of data but also permitting access to necessary information. Indeed, the same datum is often treated differently depending on context.System designers create policies to express conditions on the access to data. To reduce source clutter and improve maintenance, developers increasingly use domain-specific, declarative languages to express these policies. In turn, administrators need to analyze policies relative to properties, and to understand the effect of policy changes even in the absence of properties.This paper presents Margrave, a software suite for analyzing role-based access-control policies. Margrave includes a verifier that analyzes policies written in the XACML language, translating them into a form of decision-diagram to answer queries. It also provides semantic differencing information between versions of policies. We have implemented these techniques and applied them to policies from a working software application.  }
Paper 4:
Title: database security-concepts, approaches, and challenges
Abstract: As organizations increase their reliance on, possibly distributed, information systems for daily business, they become more vulnerable to security breaches even as they gain productivity and efficiency advantages. Though a number of techniques, such as encryption and electronic signatures, are currently available to protect data when transmitted across sites, a truly comprehensive approach for data protection must also include mechanisms for enforcing access control policies based on data contents, subject qualifications and characteristics, and other relevant contextual information, such as time. It is well understood today that the semantics of data must be taken into account in order to specify effective access control policies. Also, techniques for data integrity and availability specifically tailored to database systems must be adopted. In this respect, over the years the database security community has developed a number of different techniques and approaches to assure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, despite such advances, the database security area faces several new challenges. Factors such as the evolution of security concerns, the "disintermediation驴 of access to data, new computing paradigms and applications, such as grid-based computing and on-demand business, have introduced both new security requirements and new contexts in which to apply and possibly extend current approaches. In this paper, we first survey the most relevant concepts underlying the notion of database security and summarize the most well-known techniques. We focus on access control systems, on which a large body of research has been devoted, and describe the key access control models, namely, the discretionary and mandatory access control models, and the role-based access control (RBAC) model. We also discuss security for advanced data management systems, and cover topics such as access control for XML. We then discuss current challenges for database security and some preliminary approaches that address some of these challenges.  }
Paper 5:
Title: static checking of dynamically-varying security policies in database-backed applications
Abstract: We present a system for sound static checking of security policies for database-backed Web applications. Our tool checks a combination of access control and information flow policies, where the policies vary based on database contents. For instance, one or more database tables may represent an access control matrix, controlling who may read or write which cells of these and other tables. Using symbolic evaluation and automated theorem-proving, our tool checks these policies statically, requiring no program annotations (beyond the policies themselves) and adding no run-time overhead. Specifications come in the form of SQL queries as policies: for instance, an application's confidentiality policy is a fixed set of queries, whose results provide an upper bound on what information may be released to the user. To provide userdependent policies, we allow queries to depend on what secrets the user knows. We have used our prototype implementation to check several programs representative of the data-centric Web applications that are common today.  }
Paper 6:
Title: role-based access control on the web
Abstract: Current approaches to access control on the Web servers do not scale to enterprise-wide systems because they are mostly based on individual user identities. Hence we were motivated by the need to manage and enforce the strong and efficient RBAC access control technology in large-scale Web environments. To satisfy this requirement, we identify two different architectures for RBAC on the Web, called user-pull and server-pull. To demonstrate feasibility, we implement each architecture by integrating and extending well-known technologies such as cookies, X.509, SSL, and LDAP, providing compatibility with current web technologies. We describe the technologies we use to implement RBAC on the Web in different architectures. Based on our experience, we also compare the tradeoffs of the different approaches.  }

The paper presents a model for enforcingaccess control regulations, an XML core schema andnamespace for expressing such regulations, and illustratesthe architecture of Access Control Unit (ACU), anautonomous software component based on the proposedmodel. Besides "standard" authorizations, the ACUsupports authorizations based on user profiles and dynamicconditions whose outcome is determined by useractions such as the acceptance of a written agreementand/or payment.  }

Title: a fine-grained access control system for xml documents
Abstract: Web-based applications greatly increase information availability and ease of access, which is optimal for public information. The distribution and sharing of information via the Web that must be accessed in a selective way, such as electronic commerce transactions, require the definition and enforcement of security controls, ensuring that information will be accessible only to authorized entities. Different approaches have been proposed that address the problem of protecting information in a Web system. However, these approaches typically operate at the file-system level, independently of the data that have to be protected from unauthorized accesses. Part of this problem is due to the limitations of HTML, historically used to design Web documents. The extensible markup language (XML), a markup language promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is de facto the standard language for the exchange of information on the Internet and represents an important opportunity to provide fine-grained access control. We present an access control model to protect information distributed on the Web that, by exploiting XML's own capabilities, allows the definition and enforcement of access restrictions directly on the structure and content of the documents. We present a language for the specification of access restrictions, which uses standard notations and concepts, together with a description of a system architecture for access control enforcement based on existing technology. The result is a flexible and powerful security system offering a simple integration with current solutions.  }

Epoch:4 | IDEA | Scientist23:Thought: 
The concept of access control has been extensively explored in various domains, including computer systems, networks, and databases. However, as we delve into the realm of Web-based applications, especially those involving sensitive data, it becomes evident that traditional approaches may not be sufficient to ensure security and confidentiality. The existing solutions often rely on user identities or roles, which can lead to scalability issues in large-scale enterprise environments.

In this context, my intuition is to design a novel access control system that leverages the unique characteristics of Web-based applications. I aim to create an architecture that seamlessly integrates with current web technologies while providing robust security features.

High-level Plan:
The proposed system will be built upon the principles of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and will incorporate advanced techniques to address scalability concerns. The design will involve two primary components: a user-pull and server-pull architecture, each tailored to specific use cases. This approach will enable efficient management of access control policies across large-scale systems.

Key Design Choices:
1. **Modular Architecture**: To ensure flexibility and adaptability, the system will be designed as a modular framework, allowing for easy integration with existing web technologies.
2. **Decentralized Data Storage**: To address scalability concerns, data storage will be decentralized, ensuring that access control policies are distributed across multiple nodes.
3. **Context-Aware Access Control**: The system will incorporate context-aware features to dynamically adjust access control policies based on user actions and environmental factors.

Ideal Outcomes:
The proposed architecture is expected to provide several benefits, including:

1. **Improved Scalability**: By leveraging decentralized data storage and modular design, the system can efficiently manage large-scale enterprise environments.
2. **Enhanced Security**: The incorporation of advanced security features, such as context-aware access control, will ensure robust protection of sensitive data.
3. **Increased Flexibility**: The modular architecture will enable seamless integration with current web technologies, making it an attractive solution for a wide range of applications.

Justification:
The proposed system differs from existing solutions in several key ways:

1. **Scalability**: By addressing scalability concerns through decentralized data storage and modular design, the system can efficiently manage large-scale enterprise environments.
2. **Context-Awareness**: The incorporation of context-aware access control features will provide a more dynamic and adaptive security framework.
3. **Integration with Web Technologies**: The proposed architecture seamlessly integrates with current web technologies, making it an attractive solution for a wide range of applications.

Title: a context-aware security architecture for emerging applications
Abstract: We describe an approach to building security servicesfor context-aware environments. Specifically, we focus onthe design of security services that incorporate the use ofsecurity-relevant "context" to provide flexible access controland policy enforcement. We previously presented a generalizedaccess control model that makes significant use ofcontextual information in policy definition. This documentprovides a concrete realization of such a model by presentinga system-level service architecture, as well as early implementationexperience with the framework. Through ourcontext-aware security services, our system architecture offersenhanced authentication services, more flexible accesscontrol and a security subsystem that can adapt itself basedon current conditions in the environment. We discuss ourarchitecture and implementation and show how it can beused to secure several sample applications.  }

Title: securing context-aware applications using environment roles
Abstract: In the future, a largely invisible and ubiquitous computing infrastructure will assist people with a variety of activities in the home and at work. The applications that will be deployed in such systems will create and manipulate private information and will provide access to a variety of other resources. Securing such applications is challenging for a number of reasons. Unlike traditional systems where access control has been explored, access decisions may depend on the context in which requests are made. We show how the well-developed notion of roles can be used to capture security-relevant context of the environment in which access requests are made. By introducing environment roles, we create a uniform access control framework that can be used to secure context-aware applications. We also present a security architecture that supports security policies that make use of environment roles to control access to resources.  }

Title: context-aware role-based access control in pervasive computing systems
Abstract: In this paper we present a context-aware RBAC (CARBAC) model for pervasive computing applications. The design of this model has been guided by the context-based access control requirements of such applications. These requirements are related to users' memberships in roles, permission executions by role members, and context-based dynamic integration of services in the environment with an application. Context information is used in role admission policies, in policies related to permission executions by role members, and in policies related to accessing of dynamically interfaced services by role members. The dynamic nature of context information requires model-level support for revocations of role memberships and permission activations when certain context conditions fail to hold. Based on this model we present a programming framework for building context-aware applications, providing mechanisms for specifying and enforcing context-based access control requirements.  }
Paper 4:
Title: context sensitive access control
Abstract: We investigate the practical feasibility of using context information for controlling access to services. Based solely on situational context, we show that users can be transparently provided anonymous access to services and that service providers can still impose various security levels. Thereto, we propose context-sensitive verification methods that allow checking the user's claimed authenticity in various ways and to various degrees. More precisely, conventional information management approaches are used to compare historic contextual (service usage) data of an individual user or group. The result is a relatively strong, less intrusive and more flexible access control process that mimics our natural way of authentication and authorization in the physical world.  }

Title: context-role based access control for context-aware application
Abstract: The rapid growth of wireless network technology and the deployment of mobile computing devices have enabled the construction of pervasive computing environment. In pervasive computing environment, it is proliferated that many new applications that provide active and intelligent services by context information are collected by pervasive sensor devices. These new applications called context-aware applications must require new security mechanisms and policies different from typical ones. Specially, access control mechanism supports security policy that is based on context information, in order to provide automating context-aware services. So, this paper analyzes various access control mechanisms and proposes a context-role based access control mechanism for context-aware application.  }
Paper 6:
Title: an integrated approach to engineer and enforce context constraints in rbac environments
Abstract: We present an approach that uses special purpose role-based access control (RBAC) constraints to base certain access control decisions on context information. In our approach a context constraint is defined as a dynamic RBAC constraint that checks the actual values of one or more contextual attributes for predefined conditions. If these conditions are satisfied, the corresponding access request can be permitted. Accordingly, a conditional permission is an RBAC permission that is constrained by one or more context constraints. We present an engineering process for context constraints that is based on goal-oriented requirements engineering techniques, and describe how we extended the design and implementation of an existing RBAC service to enable the enforcement of context constraints. With our approach we aim to preserve the advantages of RBAC and offer an additional means for the definition and enforcement of fine-grained context-dependent access control policies.  }
Paper 7:
Title: access control to information in pervasive computing environments
Abstract: Many types of information available in a pervasive computing environment, such as people location information, should be accessible only by a limited set of people. Some properties of the information raise unique challenges for the design of an access control mechanism: Information can emanate from more than one source, it might change its nature or granularity before reaching its final receiver, and it can flow through nodes administrated by different entities. We propose three design principles for the architecture of an access control mechanism: (1) extract pieces of information in raw data streams early, (2) define policies controlling access at the information level, and (3) exploit information relationships for access control. We describe an example architecture in which we apply these principles. We also report how our earlier work about adding access control to a people location service contributed to the more general access control architecture proposed here.  }
Paper 8:
Title: a semantic context-aware access control framework for secure collaborations in pervasive computing environments
Abstract: Wireless connectivity and widespread diffusion of portable devices offer novel opportunities for users to share resources anywhere and anytime, and to form ad-hoc coalitions. Resource access control is crucial to leverage these ad-hoc collaborations. In pervasive scenarios, however, collaborating entities cannot be predetermined and resource availability frequently varies, even unpredictably, due to user/device mobility, thus complicating resource access control. Access control policies cannot be defined based on entity’s identities/roles, as in traditional access control solutions, or be specified a priori to face any operative run time condition, but require continuous adjustments to adapt to the current situation. To address these issues, this paper advocates the adoption of novel access control policy models that follow two main design guidelines: context-awareness to control resource access on the basis of context visibility and to enable dynamic adaptation of policies depending on context changes, and semantic technologies for context/policy specification to allow high-level description and reasoning about context and policies. The paper also describes the design of a semantic context-aware policy model that adopts ontologies and rules to express context and context-aware access control policies and supports policy adaptation.  }

Epoch:4 | IDEA | Scientist114:Thought: The current access control mechanisms in pervasive computing environments are not sufficient to provide secure and context-aware services. These mechanisms often rely on traditional role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC), which do not take into account the dynamic and changing nature of contextual information. As a result, these mechanisms may lead to over-permissioning or under-permissioning, compromising the security and integrity of sensitive resources.

In this idea, we propose the development of an adaptive access control mechanism that integrates context-awareness and role-based access control. The Context-Role Based Access Control (CRBAC) with Adaptive Policy Refinement aims to provide secure and efficient services in pervasive computing environments by continuously adapting access control policies based on changing contextual information.

Firstly, we will develop a context-role mapping framework that maps contextual attributes to roles, enabling the dynamic adaptation of access control policies. This framework will be designed to capture the complex relationships between contextual attributes and roles, ensuring that access control decisions are made with the most up-to-date information.

Next, we will implement an adaptive policy refinement mechanism that continuously updates and refines access control policies in response to changes in contextual information. This mechanism will leverage machine learning techniques to analyze patterns in contextual data and adapt access control policies accordingly.

Furthermore, we will develop a context-aware role assignment algorithm that assigns roles to users based on their current contextual attributes. This algorithm will take into account the dynamic nature of contextual information, ensuring that access control decisions are made with the most up-to-date information.

The expected outcomes of this idea include improved security and integrity of sensitive resources through adaptive access control policies, enhanced efficiency in service provision by minimizing over-permissioning or under-permissioning, and better support for dynamic changes in contextual information, enabling seamless adaptation to changing environments.

This idea is different from existing ones as it integrates context-awareness and role-based access control, providing a more comprehensive and adaptive approach to access control. The Context-Role Based Access Control (CRBAC) with Adaptive Policy Refinement offers a novel solution that addresses the limitations of traditional RBAC and ABAC mechanisms in pervasive computing environments.

In terms of feasibility, we rate this idea 7 out of 10, as it requires significant development efforts to integrate context-awareness and role-based access control. However, with the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we believe that this idea is feasible and can be implemented within a reasonable timeframe.

The interestingness rating is 8 out of 10, as this idea has the potential to provide secure and efficient services in pervasive computing environments, addressing some of the most pressing challenges in this field. The novelty rating is 9 out of 10, as this idea integrates context-awareness and role-based access control, providing a novel solution that addresses the limitations of traditional mechanisms.

Overall, we believe that the Context-Role Based Access Control (CRBAC) with Adaptive Policy Refinement has the potential to revolutionize access control in pervasive computing environments, providing secure and efficient services that adapt to changing contextual information.
